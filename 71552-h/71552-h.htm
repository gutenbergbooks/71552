<h2 class="nobreak">PREFACE</h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">The Young Volcano Explorers</span>” is a complete
story in itself, but forms the second volume
of a line issued under the general title of the “Pan-American
Series.”</p>

<p>When I began this series of tales I had in mind
to acquaint my young readers with some of the
sights to be seen in the three Americas,—especially
such portions as lie outside of the United States.
In the first volume, called “Lost on the Orinoco,”
I told of the sight-seeing and adventures of five
American lads, who, in company with their academy
professor, who is also a great traveler and hunter,
journey to Venezuela, our sister Republic on the
north-east coast of South America. The boys visit
several principal cities, inspect cocoa and coffee plantations
as well as gold and silver mines, and then explore
the mighty river already named.</p>

<p>In the present volume the scene is shifted from
Venezuela to the West Indies, that group of islands
of which Porto Rico has already become the property<span class="pagenum" id="Page_iv">[iv]</span>
of the United States. Because of the recent Spanish-American
War, and the still more recent volcanic
disturbances in Martinique and St. Vincent, these
islands are of unusual interest to us. In this book
the boys and their instructor sail from Venezuela to
Jamaica, stopping at Kingston, and then go to Havana,
Cuba. In Cuba several places of importance
are visited, and then the trip is continued to Hayti
and to Porto Rico, where the party travel overland
from San Juan to Ponce. At the latter city word is
received that the fathers of two of the boys have gone
to St. Pierre, Martinique, and the party start for
that point, only to encounter the effects of the volcanic
eruption when still far at sea. But Martinique
is visited, nevertheless, and later on St. Vincent
also, and in spite of the many dangers, all ends
happily.</p>

<p>In penning this tale I have, as usual, tried to be
as accurate as possible when giving historical or geographical
details. The latest and best American
and Spanish authorities have been consulted, and, in
the case of the disasters at Martinique and St. Vincent,
I have read with care the reports of all who
suffered and escaped, and of those who have since
visited these spots of interest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_v">[v]</span>Once again I wish to thank the many thousands
who have perused my former works. May the present
volume fulfil their every expectation.</p>

<p class="ph2">THE YOUNG VOLCANO<br>
EXPLORERS</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER I<br>

<small>INTRODUCING THE BOYS</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Here</span> comes the mail boy, Darry. Now for
letters and newspapers from home. There ought to
be plenty of letters for all of us.”</p>

<p>“Don’t be too sure Frank. The mails in Venezuela
are mighty slow, especially now when there
is another revolution on.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t believe this one-horse revolution
will have anything to do with the mails,” put in a
third boy, as he joined his chums, who were lounging
in the hallway of a spacious hotel in Caracas,
the capital city of Venezuela. “They have them
too often, you know.”</p>

<p>“Hush, don’t call it a one-horse revolution,
Beans,” returned Darry Crane, in a warning voice.
“The people who live here think it’s just as important<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span>
as any revolution that ever was—and it
probably is, to them.”</p>

<p>“There goes the professor for letters now!” burst
out Frank Newton. “Oh, I do hope he gets lots
of them!” Frank was always more anxious for
letters from home than anyone else. “Yes, here
he comes with a handful, and an armful of papers
in the bargain.”</p>

<p>The coming of the mail always attracted a crowd
of patrons of the hotel, and soon the boys found
themselves surrounded by those anxious to get their
letters and papers. Looking, they saw the gentleman
who had their mail wave his hand to them and
disappear in the direction of the hotel courtyard and
they speedily followed.</p>

<p>“What have you for me, Professor?” was the
question asked by one and all, and now two more
boys hurried up, making five in all who waited
eagerly for news from home.</p>

<p>It was an interesting group, and while the mail
matter is being distributed, we will take the opportunity
of introducing each individual to the reader.</p>

<p>The oldest boy present was Mark Robertson. He
was a lad of seventeen, and was the son of a dry
goods importer. His father owned an interest in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span>
several mills in England and Scotland and made
semi-yearly trips across the Atlantic, and the family
were well-to-do.</p>

<p>When at home Mark lived on Madison Avenue
in New York city, and directly opposite to him
lived Frank Newton, another of the boys of the
group. Although Frank was a year younger than
Mark, the two were warm chums. Frank’s father
was a banker, and if he was not a millionaire he was
certainly well provided for financially.</p>

<p>The liveliest boy in the crowd was Dartworth
Crane, always called Darry for short. He was but
fifteen, the son of a rich Chicago cattle dealer, and to
him life was one long, sunshiny holiday. It was
very hard for Darry to take anything seriously, and
his good nature was as spontaneous as it was catching.</p>

<p>“Darry would make a cow laugh,” said Frank,
more than once, and the others agreed with him.
As said before, Mark was Frank’s closest chum, but
Darry was no mean second.</p>

<p>The fourth lad of the group was a tall, well-built
individual of sixteen, with a high forehead and a
thick mass of curly hair. This was Samuel Winthrop,
generally called “Beans,” because he had been born<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
and brought up in Boston. Sam was the son of a
well-to-do widow of the Back Bay district. He was
a studious, observant young fellow, seldom, however,
given to “airing his knowledge,” and he and
Mark were as friendly as were Frank and Darry.</p>

<p>The fifth youth in the crowd was a tall, lank individual
of about Mark’s age, with a white freckled
face and reddish hair. His name was Jacob Hockley,
and he was the son of a millionaire lumber dealer of
Pennsylvania. His manner was varied, at times
exceedingly “bossy,” as the others termed it, and
then again exceedingly sour and morose. The latter
mood had won for him the nickname of “Glummy”
or “Jake the Glum,” and although he objected
strenuously to being called such a name, yet it clung
to him in spite of everything. Hockley had plenty of
money and spent it freely, but even this failed to
make him any close friendships.</p>

<p>“Glummy thinks money is everything,” said
Mark in speaking of the matter one day. “But
sooner or later he is bound to learn that there are
some things that even money can’t buy.” And
Mark was right. True friendship is never a matter
of dollars and cents.</p>

<p>For several years all these boys had attended<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
a boarding academy located among the hills of New
Hampshire. Lakeview Academy, as it was called,
was presided over by Professor Amos Strong, a
kindly and well educated gentleman, who had in
years gone by been a great traveler and hunter.
Professor Strong had often told the lads about his
hunting expeditions in various parts of the globe,
and through these stories a plan had originated to
visit Central and South America, the expedition
to be under the personal supervision of the professor
himself.</p>

<p>At first Professor Strong could not see his way
clear to leaving the academy, but a fire came and
destroyed the place, and at the same time the professor’s
brother, also a teacher, left the faculty of
Harvard. It was then arranged that the school
building should be rebuilt under the directions of
the brother, who was afterward to assume control
of the institution. This would give Professor
Strong the liberty he desired and which he, in
secret, greatly craved. For many years a wanderer
on the face of the earth, binding himself down to
steady teaching had proved rather irksome to him.</p>

<p>After a good deal of discussion it was decided
that the party of six should first visit Venezuela,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
and in the first volume of this series, entitled “Lost
on the Orinoco,” I related the particulars of the
journey from New York to La Guayra, the nearest
seaport, and told of the sight-seeing and adventures
while visiting Caracas, the capital, Macuto, the fashionable
summer resort, the great Gulf of Maracaibo,
and other points of interest, including cocoa and
coffee plantations and gold and silver mines, and
also a never-to-be-forgotten journey up that immense
river, the Orinoco, the second largest stream
in South America.</p>

<p>The boys had had adventures in plenty, and becoming
lost on the Orinoco had almost proved a
serious happening for Mark and Frank, who had
wandered away in a jungle that seemed to have no
end. All of the party had met more than one wild
animal, and a squall on Lake Maracaibo had come
close to sending them all to the bottom.</p>

<p>It was not to be expected that four such whole-souled
lads as Mark, Frank, Darry and Sam could
get along smoothly with such an over-bearing and
peculiar youth as Jake Hockley. They were sorry
that the bully was along, and it was not long before
there was a bitter quarrel and some of the boys came
to blows with Hockley. This was stopped by Professor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
Strong, who said they must do better in the
future.</p>

<p>With no special friend in the party, and with a
strong desire to be “sporty,” and to do things which
were not permitted by the professor, Hockley struck
up an acquaintance with one Dan Market, a man
from Baltimore, whose reputation was none of the
best. This Markel succeeded in getting all of Hockley’s
money away from him, and it was only through
a discovery made by Mark and Frank that Markel
was arrested and the money was recovered. But
Markel had escaped, and what had become of him
nobody knew. Getting back his money and also
a watch which had been taken, had made Hockley
friendly to Frank and Mark for the time being,
and the bully was also friendly to Sam and Darry,
for they had saved him from being crushed to death
by a boa constrictor, having shot and killed the
hideous reptile just in the nick of time.</p>

<p>It had been the intention of Professor Strong to
take the boys from Venezuela to Brazil, but while
the party was resting at a mining town called Castroville,
there came in a report that the tropical fevers
were raging in the latter republic, and that it was
likely Venezuela, Brazil, Colombia, and some other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
countries would soon be mixed up in revolutions and
wars, and it was then decided by a general vote that
they should move northward again and visit the
West Indies, taking in Jamaica, Cuba, Porto Rico,
and other important islands.</p>

<p>“That will just suit me,” said Mark, when this
decision was reached. “I want to see where the
battles of the Spanish-American War were fought
and also what sort of a place Porto Rico, our new
possession, is.”</p>

<p>“And I want to get out of a country that grows
boa constrictors,” came from Hockley. “Ugh,
they’re awful. Professor, are there such snakes in
the West Indies?”</p>

<p>“I never heard of any, Jacob. But they have
poisonous reptiles, such as are to be found in all
tropical climates.”</p>

<p>“Well, I won’t care so much for them, if they
aren’t six or seven yards long,” grumbled the tall
youth.</p>

<p>“That’s Glummy all over,” whispered Frank to
Darry. “Every time he speaks of that constrictor
he tacks a yard or two on to the length.”</p>

<p>“Never mind—it’s only a snake story, you know,”
returned light-hearted Darry. “They don’t count,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
for nobody believes them. We’ll never get credit
for killing anything more than a snake as long as
your arm.”</p>

<p>The journey from Castroville to Caracas overland
had been uneventful. They had stopped at numerous
plantations and small towns on the way, and
they had seen sheep and wild horses without number.
They had also done considerable hunting, and
each of the boys could now boast of being a creditable
shot. If there was an exception it was Hockley,
who, in spite of all the instructions given him
by the professor, would take little pains in the handling
of his gun.</p>

<p>On arriving at Caracas they put up at the same
hotel which had been their stopping place on first
visiting the capital. All had long before sent letters
home speaking of their change of plans, and they
were now anxious to ascertain how their parents
would view the matter, even though, on leaving
home, everything had been left to Professor Strong
personally, he being fully competent to judge of
what was best for all.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER II<br>

<small>NEWS FROM HOME</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Letters</span> from home are always welcome, and
doubly so when one has been out of reach of the
mail for a long time. As Professor Strong held up
nearly a dozen written communications, the lads
fairly pounced upon them, and for the time being
the newspapers were forgotten.</p>

<p>“Here’s one for Mark and two for Frank,” cried
Darry. “Where is mine?”</p>

<p>“Here you are,” said Frank, holding out three.
“And here is one for you, Jake.”</p>

<p>“And here’s another for Jake,” added Sam.
“And two for myself.”</p>

<p>“No, boys, these two are my own!” laughed
Professor Strong, holding them back. “You
mustn’t expect all the good things, you know.”</p>

<p>“Only one for me!” murmured Mark. “And
Darry has three. That’s hardly fair.”</p>

<p>“You want to send your folks a bottle of ink and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
some pens,” replied Darry. “Never mind; I’ll tell
you what’s in mine, after I read ’em.”</p>

<p>“Don’t say a word,” burst out Frank. “Look
at that letter, twelve or fifteen pages, and this one of
mine has only four pages. Mark needn’t complain.”</p>

<p>“Here’s a photograph,” came slowly from Sam.
“My mother! It was nice of her to send that.”
And he gazed at the picture affectionately.</p>

<p>Soon all were sitting in the hammocks and easy
chairs at hand reading the letters received. There
was all sorts of news from home, of more or
less interest. Mark’s father was just home from
a trip to England and Scotland, and he and Mr.
Newton were contemplating a trip together, for
business as well as pleasure. Sam’s mother had left
Boston to visit relatives up in Maine, and hoped her
only son would do his best to keep out of peril and
mischief. Darry’s letters told how his father had
gone to Colorado to look up a big cattle deal, and
there was also a letter from a sister who was just
leaving home to go to boarding school. Hockley
had word that his father had lost one saw mill by
fire but had bought two mills to take its place, and
that the elder Hockley was now president of a new
Consolidated Lumber Company.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>“Tell you what, pop’s getting there,” said Hockley,
when he told this news to the others. “He’ll
be the richest lumber dealer in the country before he
gets through,” and he fairly swelled with pride over
the announcement.</p>

<p>“I wonder where my father and yours will go,”
said Frank to Mark, after the letters had been read,
not once but several times. “It’s queer neither my
letter nor yours tells that.”</p>

<p>“I guess they hadn’t made up their minds when
the letters were written. I once heard father speak
of coming down to Cuba and Jamaica. It would be
queer if they did come down and we met them.”</p>

<p>“That would be just all right,” was the ready
return, but as Mark spoke he never dreamed of the
terrible circumstances which was to make that meeting
a reality. Could he have looked ahead it would
have caused him more than one shudder.</p>

<p>It had been determined that they should take the
train for La Guayra on the following morning.
There was to be a sailing of a steamer for Kingston
and Havana one day later, and Professor Strong
had already telegraphed ahead for the necessary
accommodations.</p>

<p>“We can take our last look around Caracas to-day,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span> 
announced Professor Strong. “Have you
boys any place in mind that you would like to visit?”</p>

<p>A general discussion arose. While it was at its
height a gentleman who had driven to the hotel in
his carriage came in and rushed up to the group.</p>

<p>“My own very dear friend, Amos Strong, once
more,” he said, with a strong Spanish accent. “I
received word last night that you and the boys had
come back to Caracas. So I made up my mind I
must see you all again. And how have you been?”
And he shook hands cordially.</p>

<p>“We are all right, Morano,” was the professor’s
reply, as the boys crowded around to speak to the
newcomer, who was a teacher at the University at
Caracas and an old college friend of Professor
Strong.</p>

<p>“But we’ve had lots of adventures,” put in Darry.</p>

<p>“To be sure, Master Darry—you could not keep
out of them. You see I have not forgotten how one
of my horses once ran away with you,” and Enrique
Morano laughed.</p>

<p>Besides being an instructor at the Caracas University,
Enrique Morano was the owner of a large
plantation just outside of the city, which the party
had once visited, much to the delight of all hands.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
Now Morano insisted that he be allowed to send for
his largest carriage and take them for a drive to such
points of interest as they elected to see.</p>

<p>This was just what the boys wished, and inside
of an hour the carriage was on hand and they piled
in. Enrique Morano himself drove, with Professor
Strong beside him. Soon the city itself was left
behind and they were bowling along over a smooth
highway in the direction of Antimano, situated some
miles to the westward.</p>

<p>It was a perfect day and the boys enjoyed the
sights greatly, as they passed plantation after plantation.
The roadway was lined at some points with
beautiful tropical trees, and flowers were by no means
lacking.</p>

<p>“Tell you what, Señor Morano keeps good horse-flesh,”
remarked Darry as they spun along. “This
is better than a drive in Lincoln Park.”</p>

<p>“Or Central Park either,” added Frank.</p>

<p>“Oh, my father keeps just as good horses,” came
from Hockley. “He’s got a trotter that can beat
all creation for stepping out on a smooth road like
this.”</p>

<p>So far they had passed but few turnouts on the
highway. But now they saw approaching a carriage<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
with a single seat, drawn by a team of horses which
were covered with foam. On the seat sat two men,
both evidently Americans.</p>

<p>“Reckless drivers,” murmured Enrique Morano,
as the other carriage came closer. “Be careful
there!” he called out, in Spanish, and pulled sharply
to one side.</p>

<p>“Clear the track!” shouted one of the men, in
English, and the tone of voice showed that he had
been drinking. “We don’t get out of the way for
no sun-baked native!” And he cracked his whip
loudly.</p>

<p>The carriage came closer and it was only by a few
inches that it missed striking Enrique Morano’s
turnout. As it swept by the boys got a good look
at the occupants.</p>

<p>“Dan Markel!” almost shouted Hockley and
Mark, in a breath.</p>

<p>“That was Markel, just as sure as you are born,”
came from Frank. “Who would have expected to
meet him here?”</p>

<p>“We ought to go after him,” continued Hockley.</p>

<p>“You evidently know the man,” said Enrique
Morano, bringing his team to a halt and gazing inquiringly
at the boys.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>“He is the man who robbed Hockley,” explained
Professor. “He was captured once, down on the
Orinoco, but he escaped.”</p>

<p>“Ah, I see. Yes, he should be caught. And the
other man, what of him?”</p>

<p>He looked at the boys again, but all shook their
heads. They could not remember having seen the
individual before.</p>

<p>“Guess he’s another victim,” was Mark’s comment.
“I don’t believe Markel had any money of
his own. He has struck up an acquaintance with
some newcomer and is doing the sponging act.”</p>

<p>“Or else he is spending the proceeds of another
robbery,” said Sam.</p>

<p>“Do you wish to go after the man?” asked Enrique
Morano.</p>

<p>“Oh, well, you might as well let him go,” yawned
Hockley. “If we make another complaint and he
is locked up, we may have to stay here as witnesses
against him.” Hockley would have liked to see
Dan Markel behind the bars but he was afraid that
the rascal might tell of some things which would
prove discreditable to both of them.</p>

<p>“I’d really like to know if that other man was a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
victim,” mused Frank, as they continued on their
way. “If he is, he ought to be warned.”</p>

<p>There the matter was dropped, and for the time
being Dan Markel was forgotten. When they came
back to Caracas at nightfall they looked in several
directions for the rascal but could catch no sight of
him. The truth of the matter was that Markel had
recognized several of the boys on the instant of passing
them, and although partly intoxicated he still
had wit enough left to keep hidden.</p>

<p>The party were to leave for La Guayra at nine in
the morning, and the boys were up long before that
time, taking a last look at their surroundings. Then
came a good breakfast, and soon they were on the
cars and winding over and around the mountains
which separate the capital city of Venezuela from
the seacoast.</p>

<p>“Here is where we had to get off and walk,” said
Mark, as the train rushed on. “Do you remember
that, Frank?”</p>

<p>“To be sure I do. And I remember how you
got lost in a hole under the cliffs, too.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and not far away is the spot where you and
Hockley pitched into each other,” whispered Mark,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
with a sly look at the bully, who sat just ahead.
He did not think the lank youth heard, but he was
mistaken.</p>

<p>“Raking up old sores, eh?” growled Hockley,
swinging around and with his face very red. “I
thought all that was to be dropped.”</p>

<p>“It is to be dropped, too, Jake,” answered Mark,
quickly.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” came with a sneer. “You’re dropping
it fast enough.”</p>

<p>“But I didn’t really mean anything, Jake,” pleaded
Mark. “It—er—just came to my mind, that’s all.
It’s past and gone now.”</p>

<p>“You can’t humbug me, Mark Robertson!
You’re laughing in your sleeve because you think
Frank got the best of me in that fight. But let me
tell you I would have come out on top if Professor
Strong hadn’t come up and stopped us.”</p>

<p>“Maybe you would not have come out on top,”
said Frank, dryly, for his temper was rising. “I
fancy I had the best of it by a good deal. Anyway,
your teeth——”</p>

<p>“Oh, let that old quarrel drop,” came from Darry,
who had caught the latter part of the conversation.
“We’re out for a good time, and let us have it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>“I’m willing to let it drop,” said Mark, readily.</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t have said a word, only Hockley—”
began Frank.</p>

<p>“That’s it, blame everything on me!” howled the
bully, his anger getting the better of him. “I knew
that pretended friendliness of yours wouldn’t last.
You are all down on me and you know it. But I’ll
show you a trick or two before we’re done—you see
if I don’t!”</p>

<p>Professor Strong had gone to the end of the car
for a drink of water and to gaze for a moment out
of the doorway. Now he returned to his seat near
the boys, and the talk came to a sudden end.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER III<br>

<small>OFF FOR JAMAICA</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">He</span> is the same old Hockley,” murmured Mark
to Frank, when he got the chance. “His friendliness
was all put on.”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t think that, exactly,” returned Frank.
“I think he meant well, but he’s one of the kind who
won’t let matters rest. I suppose it galls him to
think I had the better of that fight, and some
day he’ll try to square accounts.”</p>

<p>“In that case, Frank, you’ll have to be on guard.”</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t worry; I’ll keep my eyes open.”</p>

<p>As my old readers know, La Guayra is only a
small seaport, located on a stretch of land between
the water and the high cliffs of the mountains. It
is a dirty, ill-smelling place, and nobody lives there
who can help it.</p>

<p>“I’m glad we haven’t to stop here long,” said
Sam. “It smells like dead fish and oil mixed.
Where is the steamer?”</p>

<p>An hour later found them on board of the craft,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
an old-fashioned, tub sort of an affair named the
<i>Chester</i>. She was an English boat devoted to the
carrying trade between Trinidad, La Guayra, Kingston,
and other points in the Caribbean Sea. Her
captain was named Jason Sudlip, and he was a burly
fellow, with a reddish face and black, piercing eyes.</p>

<p>“This boat ought to be called the <i>Chestnut</i>, instead
of the <i>Chester</i>,” remarked Darry, after he and the
others had made a tour of inspection. “She’s old
enough to vote twice over. It’s a wonder she hasn’t
gone to pieces long ago.”</p>

<p>“Better not let the captain hear you talk like that,”
came from Sam. “We’re lucky to get passage, so
I was told. Steamers for Kingston and Havana
are scarce.”</p>

<p>“She is no such steamer as brought us down from
New York, that’s sure,” put in Mark. “But knocking
around as we are, we’ll have to take what
comes.”</p>

<p>Their baggage had been brought on board and
placed in their staterooms, and now the boys started
in to make themselves comfortable, for the journey
to Kingston would last about four days, and that
to Havana three or four days more.</p>

<p>“What a stuffy hole this is,” grunted Hockley, as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
he gazed around the stateroom which had been assigned
to him and Darry. “I don’t see why the
professor didn’t pick out something worth living
in. I can’t sleep here.”</p>

<p>“The professor said he had done the best he could,
Jake.”</p>

<p>“It’s a beastly shame. This ain’t fit for a mule
to stall in.”</p>

<p>“Oh, it isn’t as bad as that. However, if you
don’t like it, you can complain to the professor.”</p>

<p>Hockley would not do this and only continued to
growl, until Darry grew so sick of hearing him that
he escaped to the deck and there joined Sam and
Frank.</p>

<p>“No two ways about it, Glummy has got a bilious
attack,” he announced. “He has had the sore head
ever since we got to Caracas. Now he’s kicking
about the stateroom; says it isn’t fit for a mule. Of
course it isn’t the finest in the world, but it’s not as
bad as that.”</p>

<p>“It’s a pity he is in such a humor,” returned Sam.
“And after everything was going so swimmingly,
too. But I think I can explain it, in part at least.”</p>

<p>“Then do so by all means, Beans,” cried Darry
and Frank, in a breath.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>“I learned it by accident, when we came on board.
I picked up part of a letter Hockley had torn up. I
didn’t know it was his at the time. It read to the
effect that he couldn’t have any more money at
present, that Mr. Hockley was going to send the
funds direct to Professor Strong. Jake evidently
wanted money very much, and his father’s refusal
to give him some has upset him.”</p>

<p>“That would do it, for Glummy always wants to
cut a dash with his rocks,” said Darry. “But he
needn’t take it out on us. I’ve got to room with
him, unfortunately, but I shan’t stand much of his
cutting up.”</p>

<p>As only three staterooms were to be had, Amos
Strong had taken Sam in with himself and given
another room to Frank and Mark. This just suited
the two New York boys and they at once proceeded
to make themselves as comfortable as the limited
means permitted.</p>

<p>As the steamer was a small one and carried but
few passengers, the help was also limited, and both
the table and the staterooms were looked after by a
tall, gaunt negro who rejoiced in the name of January
Jones. The colored man was from Alabama
and had shipped some months before. He was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
thoroughly good natured, but one would never have
guessed this from his face, which was usually as
solemn as that of an owl.</p>

<p>“Be pleased to help yo’ young gen’men wid yo’
things,” he announced, on presenting himself. “Do
whatever yo’ wants me to, sah.”</p>

<p>“Thanks, but everything is about done,” said
Mark, who was addressed. Then he added: “Are
you the porter?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sah, I’se de portah an’ de waitah, sah.”</p>

<p>“Two in one, eh? All right, George, we’ll call
on you later.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sah—January Jones, sah.”</p>

<p>“January Jones!” came from Frank. “That’s
an odd name. How did they come to name you
January?”</p>

<p>“Ole massa did dat, sah—afo’ de wah, sah. Called
me January because I was boahn in July, sah—said
eberything was goin’ wrong, wid that wah comin’
on, an’ things was turnin’ ’round, sah.”</p>

<p>At this Mark and Frank laughed outright.</p>

<p>“He was certainly a humorist, January,” said
Mark.</p>

<p>“Massa was a cotton plantah, sah—had a big<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
plantation on de ribber, sah. He’s dead an’ gone
now, an’ so is de missus.”</p>

<p>“Well, then he was a planter as well as a humorist.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t nebber hear him say nuffin ’bout bein’ in
de humorist business, sah. But I was a little piccaninny
dem days an’ didn’t know nuffin. Den I
can’t do nuffin fo’ you?”</p>

<p>“Not now, but we’ll want you later,” answered
Mark, and January Jones shuffled off to call on the
others.</p>

<p>“That’s what I call a character,” said Mark, after
another laugh. “I reckon we can have some fun
with January before this trip comes to an end.”</p>

<p>Early in the morning the <i>Chester</i> left the harbor
of La Guayra, with its many ships of all nations and
its strange native fishing smacks. The boys and the
professor stood at the rail and remained there until
land became a mere blur in the distance.</p>

<p>“Farewell to Venezuela!” cried Sam, taking off
his hat and making a profound bow. “Our trip
was full of pleasure and full of excitement. May
the coming trip please us equally.”</p>

<p>“And be less full of peril,” added Professor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
Strong. “Too much excitement is worse than none
at all.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Professor, we’ve got to have some excitement,”
said Darry. “Now that it is all over I think
everything was just about right.”</p>

<p>“But I am under orders to bring you back home
safe and sound,” returned Amos Strong, with a
peculiar smile. “And how can I do that if you insist
on placing your head in the lion’s mouth?”</p>

<p>“I haven’t seen a lion yet,” said Darry, with a
vacant stare. “Where is he and where’s his
mouth?”</p>

<p>There was a general laugh, in which even the professor
joined, for he loved a joke as well as any of
them.</p>

<p>“You know I was speaking metaphorically,
Dartworth. Of course I cannot look ahead, but I
sincerely trust that you do what you can to keep out
of danger in the future. If you do not, I’ll have to
call this tour off and take you all home.”</p>

<p>“We’ll be as good as mice watched by a cat,” put
in Frank, and this caused another laugh; and then
the subject was changed and soon the group separated,
each person bent on making himself comfortable
in his own way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>But the <i>Chester</i> was not a comfortable ship, as
Mark and Frank soon learned by a tour from stem to
stern. And they also learned another thing,—that the
captain, Jason Sudlip, was anything but an agreeable
man.</p>

<p>“Hi, you, I don’t allow passengers in there,”
they heard the captain cry, while they were peering
into the chart room. “You boys must stay where
you belong while you are on this ship.”</p>

<p>“We weren’t going to touch anything, Captain,”
replied Mark, pleasantly, although he did not like
the way in which he was being addressed.</p>

<p>“Oh, I know boys—into everything they have no
business in,” retorted Captain Sudlip. “I’ve had
them on board before. You’ll have to stay where
you belong.” And he slammed and locked the door
of the chart room in their faces.</p>

<p>“He’s real sweet, isn’t he?” said Frank, as they
walked to the saloon deck. “I’m glad I don’t work
under him. I wouldn’t be a hand on this steamer
for ten dollars a day. I’ll be glad when our trip on
her is ended.”</p>

<p>Professor Strong had noticed the captain’s harsh
manner to those under him, but he said nothing, for
in his travels he had met many a captain just as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
harsh and some of them had been positively
brutal.</p>

<p>Dinner was served at five o’clock, and when the
boys came to the table with their hearty appetites—nobody
had as yet had a chance to get seasick,—they
looked at what was set before them by January
Jones with dismay.</p>

<p>“This is awful!” whispered Darry to Sam.
“This soup is regular dish-water.”</p>

<p>“I can’t eat such soup,” returned Sam. “I hope
the meat and vegetables are better.”</p>

<p>“Sorry, sah, but it’s de best de ship affords, sah,”
said January Jones, who saw that they were not
suited. “De cap’n am a werry close buyer, sah,”
he added, in a lower voice. “Can’t git nuffin cheap
enough.”</p>

<p>The meat was tough and there was hardly sufficient
to go around, while the vegetables, brought
on board the day before, were far from fresh. The
bread was also poor, and the coffee of the lowest
grade. For dessert there was a rice pudding which,
according to Darry, “was just like a chunk of dirty
rubber.”</p>

<p>Professor Strong saw that the boys were on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
point of open rebellion, but he shook his head at
them.</p>

<p>“Make the best of it,” he said. “I will see the
captain about it later and find out if the service cannot
be improved.”</p>

<p>January Jones heard the words, and they made the
solemn-looking colored man grin. “Dat’s right,
sah,” he whispered. “I hopes yo’ do kick, sah.
But yo’ wants to be careful, sah. De man wot
kicked on de las’ trip got it hot an’ heaby from de
cap’n, sah.”</p>

<p>“So there has been trouble before?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sah, lots ob trouble. But please don’t say
I tole yo’, sah. De cap’n would mos’ kill me if he
found it out,” went on January Jones. “De cap’n
am a hard one, an——”</p>

<p>The colored man did not finish, for he had turned
to leave the table, and now he found Captain Sudlip
close behind him. He gave one startled look and
dove for the door leading to the cook’s galley. The
captain followed, and one disappeared directly after
the other.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IV<br>

<small>A TALK ABOUT A MEAL</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">There’ll</span> be music now,” whispered Frank to
Darry. “That captain is a tartar if ever there was
one.”</p>

<p>The dessert had already been brought on, so
January Jones was not called on to do additional
waiting and he did not re-appear. The boys were
soon finished and went again to the deck, leaving
Professor Strong to interview the master of the
steamer.</p>

<p>It was a disagreeable duty he had to perform, but
Amos Strong was too old a traveler, and had seen
too much of life, to hesitate concerning his course of
action. Being unable to find the captain, he hailed
the first mate.</p>

<p>“I wish to see the captain at once,” he said.
“Where is he?”</p>

<p>The mate did not know, and sent a deck hand to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
hunt him up. It was a good quarter of an hour
before the master of the <i>Chester</i> put in an appearance.</p>

<p>“What is it you want?” demanded Jason Sudlip,
harshly and there was a gleam in his eyes which
was far from pleasant.</p>

<p>“I wish to complain to you, Captain Sudlip, of
the food furnished to our party.”</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with it?”</p>

<p>“Everything is the matter with it. In the first
place it is very poor in itself and in the second place
it is miserably cooked. To-day’s dinner is the
poorest which has been served to our party since we
left the United States, and that is several months
ago.”</p>

<p>“Humph! I heard you trying to raise a row at
the table. According to my way of thinking the
food is all right, and so is the cooking. Is that all
you want to see me about?”</p>

<p>“That is all, and it is quite enough. I do not
propose to stand it. I paid for first-class accommodations
for myself and for those with me, and I
shall expect such accommodations in the future. If
they are not forthcoming as soon as we get to Kingston
I shall lodge a complaint against you and sue<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
to recover, even if I have to hold myself and your
ship there to do it.”</p>

<p>At this announcement Captain Sudlip’s eyes almost
bulged out of his head with rage.</p>

<p>“Ha! do you threaten me?” he roared. “That’s
the way of all Yankees—think they can ride right
over everybody that comes along. You can’t ride
over me!”</p>

<p>“I won’t argue the point,” returned Professor
Strong, calmly. “You heard what I said, and I
am a man who always keeps his word. I once met
a fellow of your stripe at Nassau—Captain Renfaw,
of the <i>Queen Mary</i>—perhaps you know him.
He tried the same game of poor food and it cost the
owners of the ship about sixty pounds in court—and
the money came out of Captain Renfaw’s salary.
Unless there is a better service I shall treat you
exactly as I did Renfaw.”</p>

<p>With this remark Amos Strong swung around on
his heel and sauntered off. Captain Sudlip stood
for a second glaring at him, and seemed on the point
of talking back. Then he drew his lips tightly together
and walked to his private cabin.</p>

<p>The professor said nothing to the boys about what
had taken place, but they all knew that he had “laid<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
down the law” by the way the captain acted whenever
he came near them. They saw nothing of
January Jones until the day following.</p>

<p>By nightfall Hockley was taken seasick, and a
little later Sam and Mark were also suffering.
None of the attacks, however, was severe, and Frank
and Darry escaped entirely.</p>

<p>“We got cleaned out when we came down here,”
said Darry, with a grin. “My! but I’ll never forget
that dose. I thought sure I was going to turn
inside out!”</p>

<p>“Poor Hockley didn’t get a chance to boast this
trip,” replied Frank. “He was the first one taken.”</p>

<p>By morning all felt fairly well, and everybody appeared
at the table but Hockley, who was suffering
from a headache.</p>

<p>“Now we’ll see what’s what!” whispered Frank.
“This certainly looks encouraging,” and he pointed
to the clean tablecloth and the neat piles of bread
and pats of butter.</p>

<p>Breakfast seemed a long time in coming, but when
at last it did arrive it was quite a fair meal. The
quantity was not extravagant, but what there was of
it was fairly well cooked, and the coffee proved of a
much better grade, greatly to the professor’s satisfaction,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
for like many old-time travelers, he was a
great coffee drinker. Nothing was said about the
improvement in the food, but many a sly wink was
given and returned across the board.</p>

<p>While the boys were eating they saw that January
Jones was unusually silent. The negro had a
bit of court-plaster on his forehead and one side of
his jaw seemed slightly swollen.</p>

<p>“It looks to me as if January had been in a fight,”
remarked Sam, when the crowd found itself on deck.
“Do you imagine that brute of a captain attacked
him?”</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t be surprised,” returned Mark. “He
is a very easy-going, mild-mannered darkey, and a
fellow like Captain Sudlip would just take pleasure
in brow-beating him.”</p>

<p>“But isn’t it against the marine rules to strike
a man like that?” questioned Frank.</p>

<p>“I guess captains often take the law into their
own hands,” said Darry. “They can put in a complaint
of mutiny, or something like that, and a
sailor, or other ship’s hand, has no show.”</p>

<p>The day had started in bright and clear, but by
ten o’clock it began to grow misty, and soon a drizzling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
rain was falling and they were compelled to
seek the shelter of the cabin.</p>

<p>“I think we may as well improve our time by
having a talk about Jamaica,” said Professor Strong.
“We shall only stop for one day at Kingston—unless
something unforeseen happens—but it won’t
hurt to know something of this English possession.”</p>

<p>He had his map handy, and placing it on the wall
he sat down in front of it, and the boys ranged close
alongside.</p>

<p>“As you can readily see,” began the professor,
“Jamaica is an island located in the Caribbean Sea
directly north of Colombia in South America and
south of the island of Cuba. It is oval in shape and
is about one hundred and fifty miles long by fifty
miles wide. Can any of you name a State at home
of about that size?”</p>

<p>There was a few seconds of silence.</p>

<p>“If I am not mistaken New Jersey is just a little
larger than that,” answered Mark.</p>

<p>“You are right Robertson, the general length and
the general width are about the same, although New
Jersey contains more square miles than Jamaica.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
The island has a ridge of high hills running east and
west, called the Blue Mountains, and from these hills
spring over half a dozen small streams which flow
into the sea.”</p>

<p>“Can you sail on the rivers?” came from Darry.</p>

<p>“On only a few, Crane, the others contain too
many rapids and waterfalls. The deepest stream is
the Black River, which is used by small boats for
perhaps twenty-five or thirty miles. I once had an
adventure on that river, so I am not likely to forget
it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, tell us the story!” cried Frank, eagerly.
He always thought a “geography lesson” awfully
dry.</p>

<p>“It is soon told,” answered Professor Strong,
with a good natured smile. “I had been out hunting
and had slipped on a steep rock and twisted my
ankle. I went down to the river and there discovered
a rowboat. No one was at hand from
whom I could hire the boat and I could not walk
around looking up the owner. So I determined to
risk taking the boat, and jumping in I shoved off
and began to row down to the town, two miles
away. I had hardly gotten quarter of a mile when
I heard a shouting and two old Englishmen came<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
running down the river bank, yelling wildly.
They, too, had been out gunning, and before I
could come back and explain one of them aimed his
gun at me and fired.”</p>

<p>“And were you hit?” asked several of the boys
together.</p>

<p>“No, fortunately his aim was poor and the
charge passed over my head. Then I rowed to shore
in a hurry, and after a good deal of trouble explained
matters. They told me that they had had
their boat stolen by negroes three days before and
in the darkness took me for one of the negroes. I
felt like giving them a piece of my mind for shooting
at me, but as it was their boat I let the matter
drop. But I never borrowed another boat without
permission.”</p>

<p>“I’d had ’em locked up,” came from Hockley,
who had just joined the group.</p>

<p>“Well, I did not. Now to get back to Jamaica.
The mouths of the numerous rivers afford good
harbors, but the best of the shelters for ships is the
bay toward the south-east, upon which is situated
Kingston, the capital. The total population of the
island is about six hundred and fifty thousand, only
a very small part of that being white people.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>“It’s the best of the West Indies belonging to
England, isn’t it?” questioned Sam.</p>

<p>“Yes. It used to belong to Spain. It was discovered
by Columbus, on his second voyage, in 1494,
and it was taken under Spanish rule fifteen years
later. In 1655 Oliver Cromwell sent out an expedition
which captured the island, and it was ceded
to England later on. Since that time there has
been more or less trouble with the negroes, but at
present the island is at rest.”</p>

<p>“And what do the people do for a living?”
asked Darry.</p>

<p>“They raise sugar and coffee principally, and
also some fruit. The country is also becoming
something of a health resort, the climate, especially
among the hills, being fine.”</p>

<p>“I’ve often heard of Jamaica rum,” said Hockley.</p>

<p>“Yes, the island produces more of that than is
good for the people at large,” answered the professor.
“It also exports large quantities of log-wood,
and the price received is, at present, very
good.”</p>

<p>“Tell us about your hunting trips in Jamaica,”
said Frank, after a pause, during which Amos<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
Strong pointed out several of the important towns
on the map; and a long talk on hunting followed
which did not come to an end until the gong rang
for dinner. Nothing had been brought down in
the forests of Jamaica but birds—for there are no
wild animals worth mentioning—but the professor
had a manner of telling his “yarns” which was
exceedingly captivating.</p>

<p>The midday meal served was about on a par with
the breakfast. There was no more than was absolutely
necessary, but the quality was far above that
of the day previous and the cook had taken pains
with the preparation of the food. The captain did
not show himself, and even January Jones hardly
spoke a word.</p>

<p>“I hope you didn’t get into trouble on our account,
January,” observed Sam, when he got the
chance.</p>

<p>“De cap’n am a werry hard man, sah,” replied
the negro, and that was all he would say.</p>

<p>“Angry, is he?”</p>

<p>The negro nodded solemnly and walked away.</p>

<p>“I think we’ll hear more of this,” said Darry,
and he was right.</p>

<p>It grew dark early in the afternoon and the rain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
kept them in the cabin, where the boys started in
to amuse themselves in various ways.</p>

<p>“It’s small fun on board of a ship in a storm,”
said Sam. “Makes me feel like a chicken boxed
up in a hen-house.”</p>

<p>“Really?” returned Darry, dryly. “Now I
never was a chicken in a hen-house, so I don’t know
how——” and then he broke off short and dodged,
as Sam moved as if to throw a book at his head.</p>

<p>“It certainly is dead slow——” remarked Frank,
when a sudden hissing stopped him. The hissing
was followed by a roar as of an explosion and before
they could realize it the cabin began to fill with
steam.</p>

<p>“Gracious, the boiler must have burst!” ejaculated
Mark.</p>

<p>“Boiler burst!” came from the others.</p>

<p>“We had better get out on deck, boys!” called
Professor Strong. “Something is certainly very
much wrong.”</p>

<p>He had scarcely spoken when there came another
roar and worse hissing. A yell went up from some
other passengers and immediately there was wild
confusion on all sides.</p>

<p>“Oh, Professor, are we going down?” cried<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
Hockley in terror, as he clutched Professor Strong’s
arm.</p>

<p>“I hope not, Jacob,” was the reply. “Come,
we will get to the deck and provide ourselves with
life preservers.”</p>

<p>But to reach the deck through that cloud of steam
was by no means easy. Hockley was frantic and
began to yell for help. In the meantime Professor
Strong and Frank reached a number of life preservers
and passed some to the others. At last they
found themselves outside on the wet and dark deck,
wondering what was going to happen next.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER V<br>

<small>THE DEFENSE OF JANUARY JONES</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">We’ll</span> all be drowned, I know we will!”</p>

<p>The remark came from Hockley. His teeth chattered
so that he could scarcely speak.</p>

<p>“If there is any real danger I should think the
captain would have the boats lowered,” said Mark,
who, now that the first scare was over, was more
calm than any of the other boys.</p>

<p>“Perhaps it is not as bad as we anticipated,” said
the professor.</p>

<p>“Tie this life preserver on me, will you?” asked
Hockley of Sam. He already had one preserver
around his waist and now wanted this on his breast.</p>

<p>“All right,” replied Sam, and did as requested.</p>

<p>In the meantime all listened for the sound of another
explosion. Would it come, and if it did,
would it send them skyhigh? Certainly it was a
moment of terrible suspense.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>“I—I know we’ll go up,” chattered Hockley.
“And we’re ever so far from land too!”</p>

<p>But they did not go up, nor did anything more
in the nature of an explosion occur. The hissing
of steam continued for fully five minutes and then
stopped as suddenly as it had begun.</p>

<p>“I imagine the worst is over,” said Professor
Strong, after a painful silence. “Unless I am mistaken
that accident was nothing worse than the ripping
open of some steam pipes. But it may have
cost the life of a fireman, coal heaver, or engineer.
If you will all remain here I will investigate.”</p>

<p>They promised to stay where they were and he
left them, to be gone the best part of quarter of an
hour. In the meantime quietness was restored on
board, and some of the passengers went back to the
cabin, which was now free of steam.</p>

<p>“It was as I surmised,” said the professor. “Two
pipes burst and let out an immense amount of steam.
One of the firemen had his leg scalded and an engineer
had his left hand badly lacerated. They are
now repairing the damage done, and they say that
by morning we will be able to steam along the same
as usual.”</p>

<p>“I’m glad to know it’s no worse,” observed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
Frank, while Hockley wiped the cold perspiration
from his forehead. “But it’s queer the pipes should
burst. They must be old.”</p>

<p>“The engineer says he told Captain Sudlip about
the pipes needing repairs before we left La Guayra.
But the captain put him off and told him that he
would have the repairs made at Havana.”</p>

<p>“If that’s the case then that fireman and that engineer
will have it in for him,” was Mark’s comment.</p>

<p>“And they ought to have it in for him,” came
from Frank. “Those men might have been steamed
to death, and we might have been blown up in the
bargain.”</p>

<p>“Just what I say,” added Sam.</p>

<p>The rain soon cleared off and that evening the
countless stars came out to brighten up the view of
the sea. The boys made themselves easy on the
deck, taking in the scene, the single exception being
Hockley, who sat close to a cabin light, reading a
novel he had picked up at a bookstall in La Guayra.</p>

<p>“Did you see that novel Glummy is reading?”
said Sam to Frank, as he drew up his chair.</p>

<p>“I didn’t notice particularly. What is it, something
deep?” And Frank smiled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>“Very deep,” went on Sam, disgustedly. “The
title is ‘Pete Prankley, the Sassiest Boy in Sawtown;
Or, Out for a Hundred Laughs a Day.’ Did
you ever hear of such rot? I don’t see how Jake
can read it.”</p>

<p>“That’s on a level with another book he was reading—at
the hotel in Caracas. That was called
‘Gold Nose Hank, the Mine Discoverer; Or, The
Whoop-Up at Stampede Hollow.’ Just for fun I
looked through the book and made a note of the
things that happened. Gold Nose Hank shot down
three Indians, two road robbers and one government
detective. His enemies fired forty-six shots at him
but never touched him. He located nine gold mines,
said to be worth fifteen million dollars, and saved
the life of the girl five times, once from a stampede
of cattle, once from the Indians, once from a road
robber, and twice from drowning in a river which
he afterward forded without getting his cartridge
belt wet. And all that for ten cents.”</p>

<p>At this Sam burst into a merry laugh. “That
author believed in giving his reader his money’s
worth, didn’t he?”</p>

<p>“Glummy seems to have got a mania for that
sort of a story lately. The professor once took a book<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
away from him and burnt it up. But now Glummy
puts the books out of sight as soon as he sees the
professor coming.”</p>

<p>“If he keeps on he’ll be wanting to follow in the
footsteps of Gold Nose Hank or Pete Prankley,”
said Mark, who had listened to the talk. “If he
does it will get him into trouble. He will find—listen!”</p>

<p>Mark stopped short, and all of the boys listened.
From the forward deck of the steamer came a cry,
as of sudden alarm. Silence followed.</p>

<p>“That was queer,” said Sam. “It sounded to
me like January Jones’ voice.”</p>

<p>“It was January,” returned Frank. “He’s in
some sort of trouble. Come on and see what it is.”</p>

<p>The three boys rushed forward, followed by
Darry, the professor having gone to his stateroom
to change his coat. At first they could not find the
colored man, but presently located him near the forecastle.
Beside him stood Captain Sudlip, a bit of
an iron chain in his hand.</p>

<p>“That will teach you a lesson,” the captain of the
<i>Chester</i> was saying. “You’ve needed it ever since
you came on board.”</p>

<p>To this January Jones made no answer. He was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
wiping the blood from his nose and from a cut on
his left hand.</p>

<p>“The captain has been striking that negro,”
whispered Sam. “It is an outrage and I mean to
tell him so.”</p>

<p>“Don’t do it, Beans,” cried Mark, catching him
by the arm. “You’ll only get yourself into
trouble.”</p>

<p>But Sam would not listen. He was ordinarily a
quiet, studious boy, but now his stern New England
sense of justice was aroused, and tearing himself
loose he hurried up and confronted the master of
the steamer.</p>

<p>“I think it’s a shame for you to strike this man,”
he said, in a loud, clear voice. “I know you are the
captain but I don’t think you have a right to abuse
any of your crew.”</p>

<p>At this frank speech Jason Sudlip stared in open-mouthed
astonishment. For the moment he fancied
he had not heard aright.</p>

<p>“Why—er—what——” he began, and then his
eyes blazed with sudden fury. “Get out of here!”
he roared. “Get out, I say! If you don’t I’ll
knock you down!”</p>

<p>His advance was so threatening that Sam put up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
his hands to defend himself. But he did not back
away, and Captain Sudlip stopped when directly in
front of the lad.</p>

<p>“Did you hear me?” he stormed. “I want you
to get where you belong. I’ll treat this nigger as
I please. By Jove, I think you need a good licking
too!” And he raised the chain as if to strike.</p>

<p>But now Darry ranged up alongside of Sam. “If
you fight, you’ll have to fight me too,” he declared.
“He said it was a shame for you to abuse January
Jones and it is. No decent captain would act as you
are acting on this trip.”</p>

<p>If possible this declaration made Jason Sudlip
more furious than ever. He was naturally of a
vindictive nature and he glared at the boys as if he
would like to “chew ’em” up.</p>

<p>Mark and Frank were not long in advancing as
Darry had done, and the sight of the four boys, with
their determined faces, caused Captain Sudlip to
pause again. He glanced around, but in the semi-darkness
of that portion of the deck no one was visible
but the boys, January Jones and himself.</p>

<p>“Don’t you know you are carrying matters with
a high hand, dictating to me on my own ship?” he
demanded, in a slightly milder tone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>“I am not dictating to you,” replied Sam. “But
if this man needs protection and I can aid him I will,
that’s as sure as you stand there. I don’t know
much about the sea, but I think the time has gone
by when a captain can treat his crew like a lot of
slaves.”</p>

<p>“Dat’s right, I ain’t no slabe no moah,” came
from January Jones, who was beginning to pick up
a little courage, now he saw he had so many to side
with him.</p>

<p>“You keep quiet!” stormed the captain, shaking
his fist at the colored man. “I’ll settle this with
you at another time,” and then January Jones slunk
back, fearful that he had “put his foot into it”
worse than ever.</p>

<p>“Captain, I can’t see why we can’t settle this little
affair in a friendly way,” said Mark, after an awkward
pause. “We don’t want any trouble. If
you’ll only treat that colored fellow as he should
be treated, and continue to serve us with decent
meals, there won’t be any cause for——”</p>

<p>“I don’t want any preaching from a boy!” interrupted
the captain. “I know my business and I
want you to mind yours.”</p>

<p>“All right, we will,” came from Darry. “But<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
just the same, we are going to keep an eye on you
so long as we remain on board. And if you do anything
more that the law doesn’t allow you’ll hear
from us; isn’t that so, fellows?”</p>

<p>A chorus of assent followed.</p>

<p>“I won’t talk to you further,” growled Captain
Sudlip, and turning on his heel he started off. His
direction was toward January Jones, and that individual
lost no time in getting out ahead and disappearing
to parts unknown.</p>

<p>“He is a brute and no mistake,” was Sam’s comment,
when they were once more left to themselves.
“I believe he would have half killed that darkey if
we hadn’t come up.”</p>

<p>“Don’t worry but that the captain has it in for
you,” came from Frank. “And in for Darry, too.”</p>

<p>“I guess he’d have it in for all of us—if he got
the chance,” said Mark. “But we mustn’t give him
the chance. In the future, while on shipboard, we
had better keep together.” And on this the boys
agreed.</p>

<p>When they returned to where the professor was
sitting he asked them where they had gone so suddenly.</p>

<p>“Oh, we took a walk forward,” said Sam, carelessly,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
and then to stop further questioning asked
Professor Strong how far he thought they were on
their journey and when they would arrive at Kingston.</p>

<p>Hockley had finished his so-styled humorous
book, and now came out to listen to what the crowd
might have to say. But he was not interested and
soon began to yawn.</p>

<p>“I’d rather sleep than sit out here gazing at nothing
but stars and water,” he said, and shuffled off
to his stateroom.</p>

<p>It was about an hour later when the professor and
the boys also retired. Mark and Frank who, as told
before, roomed together, had just undressed when
there came a slight knock on the door.</p>

<p>“Who is it?” asked Mark.</p>

<p>“It’s me, sah,” came in the low voice of January
Jones. “I dun stole down heah widout de cap’n
knowing it.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” Mark opened the door several inches.
“What can we do for you now, January?”</p>

<p>“Nuffin, sah, thank yo’, sah. I jess come down
heah to thank yo’ fo’ what yo’ done fo’ me, sah. It
was werry kind, dat was, sah. An’ I thought I’d
tell you dat I ain’t a-gwine to stay on dis ship no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
longer dan I can help, sah. It ain’t good fo’ my
constitution, sah, no, sah!”</p>

<p>“That’s right, it isn’t,” laughed Frank. “But
you’ll have to stay on board until you strike land.
Is that all?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sah. Thought I couldn’t go to sleep widout
thankin’ yo’ sah, nohow. Please tell dem other
gents, will yo’, sah?”</p>

<p>“We will.”</p>

<p>“Thank yo’, sah, much obliged, sah!”</p>

<p>And with these words January Jones sneaked off
as noiselessly as he had come.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VI<br>

<small>AN INTERRUPTION TO SIGHT-SEEING</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Two</span> days later the <i>Chester</i> slipped into the fine
harbor at Kingston and dropped anchor. It was
cloudy, but by noon the sun broke forth and the boys
had a chance to look at the shipping, which is fairly
extensive. As usual in West Indian ports, the flags
of many nationalities were flying, and the scene
was full of interest.</p>

<p>Since the boys had stood up so bravely in defense
of January Jones they had seen but little of
Captain Sudlip, he evidently making it a point to
avoid them. And they also saw but little of January
Jones, for the negro was assigned to other
work and a strange hand placed to wait on the table
and care for their rooms. The service all around
was fairly good, but, as Darry expressed it, “nothing
to brag about.”</p>

<p>“Are we going to get a chance to stretch our legs
on shore?” questioned Sam, as he gazed over the
rail at the narrow and crowded streets of the town.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>“The professor has got to find that out,” said
Frank, who had just been speaking to Amos Strong.
“He says he paid our passage right through to
Havana, so we can’t bid good-bye to Captain Sudlip
just yet.”</p>

<p>A little later Professor Strong joined them with
the information that the <i>Chester</i> would remain in
Kingston harbor until the following day until three
o’clock.</p>

<p>“Then we can take quite a look around,” said
Mark. “Are there any points of interest to visit?”</p>

<p>“A few only. You see, England has tried hard
to make something of the island, but as yet there are
too many negroes here to suit Americans. But we
will take it in for what it is worth.”</p>

<p>It was decided that they should put up at the
Queen’s Hotel over night and they so notified Captain
Sudlip.</p>

<p>“All right, do as you please,” he growled. “But
it won’t take anything off your passage money.”</p>

<p>“I did not expect it would,” replied Professor
Strong, coldly.</p>

<p>They were soon ashore and walking up the narrow
and dirty street leading from the quay. On<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
either side were big warehouses with here and there
a low drinking resort, around which hung sailors
of many nationalities and crowds of negroes.</p>

<p>“This is not very inviting,” was Sam’s comment.
“It smells almost as bad as at La Guayra.”</p>

<p>“It is not so bad further away from the docks.”</p>

<p>They soon reached the hotel, a comfortable resort
with large shade trees in the courtyard and a fountain,
and here Professor Strong secured accommodations
for all.</p>

<p>“Kingston contains about fifty thousand inhabitants,”
said the professor, after they had secured a
large carriage in which to drive around. “It was
established about two hundred years ago, after the
neighboring town of Port Royal had been destroyed
by earthquake. Now Port Royal has been rebuilt.
It lies on the other side of the harbor, but Kingston
is the main city, and nearly all the foreign commerce
passes through this port.”</p>

<p>“Have they any railroads?”</p>

<p>“When I was here last they had a railroad about
ten miles long, running from here to Spanish Town,
in the interior. The lay of the land is not favorable
to railroads.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>“I knew some sick folks who came to Jamaica
for their health,” said Hockley. “A man and his
son. Both had consumption.”</p>

<p>“Yes, invalids come here in plenty, and there are
several hotels up in the hills built especially for their
benefit.”</p>

<p>They were soon at the principal square of the
city, called the Parade. Here were numerous shops,
as well as a barracks for the soldiers, a church,
theater, and other public buildings. The Parade
was well kept, quite in contrast to the streets through
which they had been passing.</p>

<p>It was a relief, when they returned to the hotel,
to find a first-class meal awaiting them, something
that “topped clean over old Sudlip’s lobscouse,” as
Darry put it, borrowing a favorite sailor’s expression.</p>

<p>It was decided to take a run up to Spanish Town
the next morning. They could get a train about
ten o’clock, and that would give them ample time to
look around and get back before three, the time
when the <i>Chester</i> would set sail.</p>

<p>All of the boys were up bright and early on the
following morning with the exception of Hockley,
who snored away until Professor Strong called him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>“I don’t want to get up,” he grumbled. “Nothing
to see in this dead hole.” Yet when dressed he
joined the others in a trip to several public buildings,
where an English official kindly showed them
around.</p>

<p>Ten o’clock found them at the depot, waiting for
the train which was to take them to Spanish Town,
and here they discovered that the time table had been
changed and the train would not leave until half
an hour later.</p>

<p>“But we can get back before three even so,” announced
Amos Strong, after studying the schedule.
“I fancy none of you want to return to the <i>Chester</i>
until it’s necessary.”</p>

<p>They waited around and at last the little locomotive,
with its three coaches rolled in. As it came to
a stop they heard a yell, and looking around, saw
January Jones coming toward them on a dead
run.</p>

<p>“Hello! what does he want?” exclaimed Mark.
“Something is up, that’s certain.”</p>

<p>“Stop! stop!” called out the negro, as soon as he
was within speaking distance. “Doan yo’ go fo’
to take dat train, less yo’ want to lose de ship!”</p>

<p>“Lose the ship?” queried Professor Strong.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
“What do you mean? We expect to be back before
three o’clock.”</p>

<p>“De ship am gwine to sail at one o’clock, sah.”</p>

<p>“One o’clock!” came from all of the others.
And then the boys looked at the professor inquiringly.</p>

<p>“Captain Sudlip told me he would sail at three
o’clock,” said Professor Strong. “I asked him
twice to make sure.”</p>

<p>“I ’spect he did, sah, but I heard him tell de mate
dat dey must sail promptly at one o’clock, sah—dat
he wouldn’t wait fo’ nobody, sah.”</p>

<p>“It’s a trick to leave us behind!” burst out Mark.
“He has our money and that is all he cares.”</p>

<p>“But he told me three o’clock,” persisted the professor.
“Although I have no witness to that fact!”
he added, suddenly, a light breaking in on him.</p>

<p>“Then that is where he has us foul!” came from
Frank. “It’s a good thing January told us this,”
he continued, and gave the negro a grateful look.</p>

<p>“Tole yo’ I would do sumt’ing if I got de
chance,” said the negro, with a grin.</p>

<p>“All aboard!” called the train porter.</p>

<p>“We are not going,” answered Professor Strong;
and a minute later the train was off.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>“Yo’ see it was dis way,” continued January
Jones, as they walked away from the station. “I
heard one ob yo’ young gen’men tell de udder ’bout
gitting back befo’ three o’clock. Den when I heard
what Cap’n Sudlip said to de mate I knowed sumt’ing
was wrong. So I made up my mind to dun tole
yo’. I went to de hotel fust an’ dey tole me to come
heah.”</p>

<p>“We’ll not forget your kindness,” said Professor
Strong. “It was certainly a mean trick on Captain
Sudlip’s part and I shall tell him so. Of course if
we had been left I could not have brought suit
against him for damages, since I have no witness to
prove that he said he would sail at three o’clock.”</p>

<p>“Tell yo’, sah, I’se mighty sick ob workin’ fo’
dat man, sah,” observed January, with a shake of his
woolly head. “I’d leave de ship heah, only dis ain’t
much ob a place.”</p>

<p>“No, I would advise you to remain until you
reach Havana,” answered Professor Strong. “I
have a number of friends in that city and perhaps
I can get you something to do there.”</p>

<p>This pleased January Jones greatly, and he
promised to do what he could for them so long as
they were together.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>As there was nothing much to do at present, they
walked back to the hotel, where they procured
dinner. In the meantime the negro, who had been
sent ashore on an errand, hurried back to the steamer
with all speed.</p>

<p>At quarter to one o’clock Captain Sudlip came on
deck and looked around him anxiously. He was all
ready to sail and so far had seen nothing of his five
passengers. He gazed ashore but not one of them
was in sight.</p>

<p>“I’ve won the game this time,” he muttered to
himself. “And they can’t prove anything either.
It was as slick as any Yankee move. They’ll be
mad enough when they realize how I have outwitted
them. And I’ve got the passage money safe
in the cabin. Let me see, by dropping them behind
I clear just about twenty pounds. I can tell the
owners that they paid their way only as far as Kingston
and they will never know differently.”</p>

<p>As the minutes went by he looked at his watch
nervously. Ten minutes to one and no one in sight—five
minutes. He called to the first mate.</p>

<p>“All ready to sail?”</p>

<p>“Aye, aye, sir,” was the answer. “But I haven’t
seen anything of those Americans.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>“Well, it’s their own fault if they don’t come
aboard in time. I shall not wait for them.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t think you would, sir,” answered the mate,
but in such a low voice that Captain Sudlip did not
hear him.</p>

<p>At one minute to one the lines were cast off and
as a distant bell tolled the hour the <i>Chester</i> began to
move from the harbor. Standing near the pilot
house Captain Sudlip continued to gaze ashore. But
those he was fearful of seeing did not show themselves
and presently he heaved a sigh of relief and
satisfaction. Half an hour later Kingston Harbor
and Jamaica itself were left behind and the <i>Chester</i>
stood boldly out into the Caribbean Sea.</p>

<p>“Dumped ’em!” said the captain to himself, with
a smile of intense satisfaction. “That will teach
’em a lesson. They can’t ride over me!” And
then he added, after a pause, “Now I’ve got that
nigger to myself, won’t I just teach him a lesson?
He won’t be able to stand when I get through with
him!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VII<br>

<small>THE JOKE ON CAPTAIN SUDLIP</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">But</span> were our friends left behind, as Captain Sudlip
so fondly hoped? Let us go back and see.</p>

<p>It was light-hearted Darry, always ready for a
joke, who offered the suggestion, while they were
eating dinner at the Queen’s Hotel.</p>

<p>“Say!” he exclaimed, suddenly, thumping the
table in his excitement. “I’ve got a scheme for paying
Captain Sudlip off for his meanness.”</p>

<p>“Have you?” came from Professor Strong.
“Even so, please don’t pound the dishes from the
table, Darry.”</p>

<p>“Oh, excuse me, I forgot, sir. But really, the
scheme is just the thing,” went on Darry, earnestly.</p>

<p>“Then let us have it by all means,” put in Frank.
“I’m ready to do anything to get square with that
man.”</p>

<p>“My scheme is this: Let us try to get on board
of the <i>Chester</i> on the sly. Then, when he is congratulating
himself on leaving us behind we can<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
suddenly appear. I’ll wager that will knock him
silly.”</p>

<p>“Hurrah; that’s a go!” shouted Frank.</p>

<p>“A splendid plan,” came from Sam.</p>

<p>“We’ll have a tough job of it, getting on board
without being seen,” remarked Hockley, who was
envious because he had not made the suggestion.
“There is always somebody on deck, and that somebody
will let the captain know of our coming.”</p>

<p>“We must watch our chance,” said Darry.
“Anyway, it’s worth trying, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>All the boys agreed that it was, and Professor
Strong could not help but smile at their enthusiasm.
At once they made him promise to come into the
plan, and he finally consented.</p>

<p>“But I am not going to sneak on board like a
criminal,” he said.</p>

<p>Soon they were down at the docks and here they
met January Jones, who had just completed his
errand. They took the negro into their confidence
and he promised to come on deck and wave his big
red bandanna handkerchief when the coast was
clear.</p>

<p>Fortunately the plan worked with ease. Captain
Sudlip was not dreaming of their return by half-past<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span> 
twelve and they came on board seen only by
January and one of the deck hands. This deck
hand loved the captain no more than did the negro
and he readily consented to remain silent concerning
the American passengers.</p>

<p>Once on the steamer the party did not go to their
staterooms but to a storeroom which January pointed
out to them. It was a fairly comfortable spot, and
here they remained until the steamer was under
way. While sitting here the boys completed their
plan, which made even Professor Strong smile
broadly.</p>

<p>It was Darry who ventured forth first, showing
himself when the harbor had been left many miles
behind. He strolled on deck as coolly as possible,
passing the captain without appearing to notice the
latter.</p>

<p>Captain Sudlip was nearly dumfounded and stared
as if he was looking at a ghost.</p>

<p>“Why—er—er,” he stammered. “When—er—when
did you come on board?”</p>

<p>“Not very long ago,” answered Darry, coolly.</p>

<p>“Hum! Did you—er know—I mean, did you
have a nice time?”</p>

<p>“First-class, although I should have liked to have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
seen more.” And then Darry added, before the
captain could speak again: “Seen anything of the
rest of our crowd?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Queer. They must be somewhere,” and then
Darry walked away, leaving Captain Sudlip staring
after him.</p>

<p>“He must have left the others of his party,”
mused the master of the <i>Chester</i>. “Humph! Well,
I won’t treat him any too good. He’ll find out that
he can’t boss me as the whole crowd did. If he
gives me any lip I’ll lock him in the brig.”</p>

<p>Darry lost no time in retreating to the storeroom,
where he told his story. Then Mark sauntered forth
and passed the captain as the latter was entering
the cabin.</p>

<p>This time Captain Sudlip’s jaw dropped in chagrin
as well as amazement. He was about to back away
without a word, but Mark did not allow this.</p>

<p>“Well, Captain, I see you got away on time,” he
said, pleasantly. “Nothing like being prompt,
eh?”</p>

<p>“Hum! Why—er—yes, I always sail on time,”
came back, in snappy tones. “I—er—when did
you come aboard?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>“Not very long ago,” and then Mark added, as
Darry had done: “Seen anything of the rest of our
crowd?”</p>

<p>“Saw one,” was the short answer, and then Captain
Sudlip passed on, his face full of perplexity and
chagrin.</p>

<p>It was Frank he met next. The boy had a book
in his hand and pretended to be reading. But on
catching sight of the captain he sang out cheerily:
“Hi, Captain Sudlip, have you seen anything of the
rest of our crowd?”</p>

<p>“Some of ’em,” growled the master of the
steamer, and walked in another direction, to encounter
Sam, who came up to him with a handkerchief
to his eyes.</p>

<p>“Oh, Captain, Captain Sudlip!” he exclaimed
tearfully. “I—I’m in trouble.”</p>

<p>“Trouble?” demanded the captain, wrathfully.
“What’s wrong?”</p>

<p>“Have you—have you seen anything—of—the—rest—of—our
crowd?”</p>

<p>“Find out for yourself!” roared Captain Sudlip.
“If this is a joke let me say I don’t stand for it!”
And he rushed off for his private cabin.</p>

<p>Here he met Hockley, who had been waiting several<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
minutes to interview him. But he was no
longer surprised and was on the point of passing
when the youth held him up.</p>

<p>“I say, Captain,” he began, “have you seen anything
of the rest——”</p>

<p>“So you think you’re going to make a monkey of
me?” exploded Captain Sudlip, in a fury. “Think
you are going to make laughing stock of me, do you?
I won’t stand it. How do you like that, you impudent
rascal!”</p>

<p>“That” was a slap from his broad palm, which
took poor Hockley fairly and squarely in the mouth
and sent him on his back. The captain would have
followed it up with more violence, but just then
Professor Strong appeared.</p>

<p>“Stop that!” he commanded, sternly. “What
right have you to touch this young man, sir?”</p>

<p>“He insulted me,” answered the captain, but
turned somewhat pale. “I won’t be insulted on my
own ship!” he added, doggedly.</p>

<p>“How did he insult you?”</p>

<p>“Didn’t insult him,” spluttered Hockley, rising.
“I just asked him the question we agreed on,—if
he had seen any of the rest of our crowd,—when he
up and knocked me down.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>“I—I won’t argue the matter,” interrupted Captain
Sudlip. “I know your game. After this you
can mind your own business and leave me alone.”</p>

<p>“We will leave you alone,” answered Professor
Strong, as calmly as ever. “But first I am going
to have my say. I know of your trick to leave us
behind. You told me you would sail at three
o’clock and then you changed the time to one
o’clock.”</p>

<p>“I did not, I——”</p>

<p>“We won’t argue that matter. Fortunately we
got back before one o’clock, so your little plan was
nipped in the bud. We are going to sail with you
as far as Havana, and you must treat us fairly while
we are on board, otherwise I shall enter a complaint
with the owners of this ship. And as for hitting
this young man, you must apologize or I will back
him up in having you arrested as soon as we reach
port.”</p>

<p>At these final words from Amos Strong the captain’s
face became a study. There was a look of
rage and hate there, mingled with that of baffled
cunning. He had gotten himself in a tight corner
and he knew it. Two other passengers had seen the
assault on Hockley, so there were witnesses enough<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
to his misdeed. The talk had collected quite a
crowd, including all the boys.</p>

<p>“So you think I ought to apologize?” he said,
slowly.</p>

<p>“Yes, and you’ve got to do it, too!” put in Hockley,
growing bolder, now he saw that Professor
Strong was, for once, backing him up.</p>

<p>“You had no right to play a joke on me.”</p>

<p>“I was only asking you a simple question.”</p>

<p>“Hum! I know you! But I may have—er—been
hasty in hitting you,” went on Captain Sudlip,
lamely. “And if I was I—er—apologize.”</p>

<p>And with this he walked off, and did not show
himself again until the next day.</p>

<p>“I reckon we got square,” said Darry, later on,
when they talked the matter over. “He’ll be mad
over this affair every time he thinks about it.”</p>

<p>“It was all right enough for you fellows,”
grumbled Hockley, who was nursing a swollen lip.
“You didn’t catch what I got.”</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you strike back, Glummy?” asked
Mark.</p>

<p>“I didn’t get the chance, the professor came up so
quickly. Otherwise I would have wiped up the
deck with him,” blustered the would-be bully.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>All of the others had their opinion about Hockley’s
ability to “wipe up the deck” with anybody, but
they said nothing on that point, for certainly he had
caught the bitter end of the joke.</p>

<p>“And now we’ve got to wait and see how Captain
Sudlip treats us for the rest of the trip,” said Mark,
when the meeting broke up.</p>

<p>“And how he treats January Jones,” said Darry.
“Don’t forget that poor fellow. My! what would
Captain Sudlip do to him if he knew he was the one
who had brought us the news?”</p>

<p>As might be expected, Jason Sudlip was in anything
but a sweet temper during the days spent in
making the run around the western end of Cuba to
Havana. But he managed to steer clear of Professor
Strong and his party, and the meals furnished,
while not particularly good, were still such as to be
above complaint.</p>

<p>It was on his crew that Captain Sudlip emptied
his vials of wrath, and everybody caught it from
the first mate down to January Jones and the cabin
boy. This led to more than one quarrel, and before
the <i>Chester</i> reached Havana half the help on board
were on the verge of mutiny.</p>

<p>“I won’t stand this,” said the second mate. “If<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
the first mate won’t make a complaint to the owners
I will!”</p>

<p>“I do not blame you,” answered Professor
Strong, to whom he was speaking. “I think you
have a clear case. If you wish it, I will write out
a letter stating such facts as I know, and I will sign
it, and so can the young men with me.”</p>

<p>This offer was readily accepted, and when the
<i>Chester</i> reached the harbor at Havana the second
mate had the paper safe in his possession. He had
talked the matter over with the others on the steamer
and five men joined in making a complaint, not
alone to the owners but also to the authorities. As
a result Captain Sudlip was discharged by the owners
of the steamer and the first mate became the commander,
and the second mate became first. The
mate was willing to keep January Jones, but the
colored man remembered what Professor Strong had
promised and went ashore to stay there.</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VIII<br>

<small>SIGHT-SEEING IN HAVANA</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> boys watched the entrance into the harbor of
Havana with interest, and as they approached the
shore Professor Strong pointed out the various objects
to which he wished to draw their attention.</p>

<p>“As you doubtless remember,” he said, “during
the War with Spain, in 1898, the city of Havana
and several other cities in this neighborhood were
blockaded for many months, so that it was next to
impossible for the Spaniards to get any supplies
from outside or to send any goods away from these
ports. A number of vessels tried to run the blockade
but nearly every one was captured, so that when
the war was over our sailors had quite a lot of prize
money coming to them.”</p>

<p>“Is that Morro Castle?” asked Mark, pointing
to a high fortification to the left of the harbor entrance.</p>

<p>“Yes, that is old Morro, and over on the right
is Punta Castle, and beyond that is the Queen’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
battery, a long fortification, which, as you can see,
shelters the city itself from the sea. It was these
fortifications, Morro, Punta, and the batteries to
the west, that kept our ships at a distance during
the blockade.”</p>

<p>“I should like to visit Morro Castle,” came from
Sam.</p>

<p>“I think there will be no difficulty, although, you
must remember, the American troops have now been
withdrawn from the city and all of Cuba is now in
the sole possession of the Cubans.”</p>

<p>“Well, I guess they have a friendly feeling towards
Yankees,” came from Frank. “At least, they
ought to have—we did so much to help them establish
their freedom.”</p>

<p>“The entrance to the harbor is about a mile from
the harbor itself,” went on Professor Strong, “and
the city lies entirely on the west shore. Roughly
speaking it is about a mile and a quarter square and
contains about two hundred and forty thousand inhabitants.
It is divided into the old city and the
new, the former being within the old walls and being
very much cluttered-up, and the latter being on
the outskirts, where there are many fine buildings
and summer residences. The harbor of Havana is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
a place that no real American is likely to forget.
Can you tell me why?”</p>

<p>“Because the battleship <i>Maine</i> was blown up
here,” came from one and another.</p>

<p>“Exactly, lads, and the blowing up of the <i>Maine</i>
hastened on the war which resulted in Cuban liberty.
I think we shall be able to see the spot where she
sank, although the wreckage has been cleared away.”</p>

<p>“I will show you the place,” said one of the other
passengers, and he pointed it out, not many rods
from the shore. “I was here at the time,” he went
on. “The explosion was a very terrifying one, and
broke a good deal of the glassware in the hotel at
which I was stopping.”</p>

<p>It was not until several hours later that they were
allowed to land, after a Cuban Custom House
official had passed their baggage. Professor Strong
knew exactly where he wished to go, so there was no
hesitation on that score.</p>

<p>“What narrow streets!” exclaimed Frank, as
they passed along, the boys having elected to walk,
in order to see the sights more fully. “Why they
are no better than alleyways. This sidewalk is
barely two feet wide.”</p>

<p>“That is the way they used to build the streets,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
answered the professor with a laugh. “They know
better now, and the new part of the city has some
very broad and well-shaded highways, and also a
great number of beautiful fountains.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see how wagons can pass each other—especially
those long things they call <i>volantes</i>,” came
from Hockley.</p>

<p>“There used to be a regulation that carriages and
carts could only pass through a street in one direction.
I presume that is still in force in the old part
of the town.”</p>

<p>It was not long before they came to the main
thoroughfare of Havana, with its quaint Spanish
name of <i>Isabel Segunde</i>. Here, as the professor
had said, were broad walks with numerous trees,
and many fountains. Here was also located the
hotel for which they were bound, a large three-storied
affair, with broad verandas upon all sides,
and the usual courtyard, or <i>patio</i>, in the center.</p>

<p>“This is quite like home,” declared Darry, as he
looked around. “I have heard half a dozen folks
speaking English. It’s a good deal different from
Caracas.”</p>

<p>“The war made the difference, Dartworth. Before
that time Havana was as foreign a town as one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
could find on this side of the Atlantic, and that too
although it is but a short journey from Florida.”</p>

<p>The walk to the hotel had tired the party, and all
of the boys, especially Hockley, were glad to rest in
the <i>patio</i>, with its easy chairs and its cooling fountain.
From a distance came the sounds of a band
playing some popular air and the effect was most
soothing.</p>

<p>“This is what I want,” was the tall youth’s comment.
“Beats walking in the hot sun all to pieces.”</p>

<p>“Tell you what, Glummy, the next time you walk
you had better ride,” said Frank, with a yawn.</p>

<p>There was a laugh at this “bull” and Hockley’s
face grew sour at once.</p>

<p>“How many times must I tell you not to call me
‘Glummy’? I don’t want it and I won’t stand
it.”</p>

<p>“All right then, sit down—it’s what we are here
for,” returned Frank. “But I’ll try to remember,”
he added, as he saw that Hockley’s anger was rising.</p>

<p>“See that you do,” growled the big fellow, and
then he dropped into an easy chair and soon fell
asleep.</p>

<p>“He hasn’t got over that affair on the steamer,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
whispered Mark. “He thinks one of us ought to
have had that knock-down from Captain Sudlip.”</p>

<p>“Oh, let us forget Captain Sudlip,” said Frank.
“I never want to see him again. He was too mean
to live.”</p>

<p>Professor Strong had to attend to several matters,
including the getting of money on his letter of credit,
and while he was gone the boys made themselves at
home at the hotel. The quaint hostelry possessed
every comfort and all would have been content to
have remained there a long while.</p>

<p>But this was not to be. It had already been arranged
that they should spend three days in sight-seeing
in and around Havana, and then take side
trips to Matanzas, Cardenas and other important
cities not far away. After this they were to journey
to Santiago, where they were to go out on horseback
and view El Caney, San Juan, and other battlefields
of the late war.</p>

<p>When the professor came in on the evening of the
second day, he had a treat in store for them.</p>

<p>“I was passing the Tacon, the principal theater
of Havana, when I saw an announcement of a celebrated
Spanish dramatic company which is playing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
there in a round of standard dramas. I would like
you to see this playhouse, for its size and beauty is
known all over the world, and so I purchased tickets
for to-night’s performance.”</p>

<p>“Good!” came from Darry and Frank in a
breath.</p>

<p>“I’d like to see a play first rate,” said Mark.
“What is it?”</p>

<p>“Othello. I suppose you have all seen this, so
you can follow the play even if it is in Spanish.”</p>

<p>“Oh, pshaw! I thought it was some Spanish
variety show,” sighed Hockley.</p>

<p>“I should not care to take you to a variety show,
Jacob.”</p>

<p>“But this will be dead slow.”</p>

<p>“If you don’t care to go, you can stay here.”</p>

<p>“I guess I’ll stay here then,” answered Hockley.
“I’ve got something of a headache, anyway. I’ll
go to bed early.”</p>

<p>Hockley’s headache was largely imaginary, and
his thoughts were on another novel he had picked up,
“Handsome Jack, the Dead Game Sport of
Chicago.” He had left off where Handsome Jack
was confronted by four gamblers who wished to rob
him of his fifty thousand dollar diamond stud, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
he was anxious to read on and find out how the
“hold-up” terminated.</p>

<p>“Very well, Jacob,” said Professor Strong. “If
you have a headache I think the best thing you can
do is to sleep it off. Probably the sight-seeing has
been too much for your eyes.”</p>

<p>At the proper hour the boys were ready to attend
the performance at the Tacon. They were attired in
their best, for at this opera house, people invariably
wear the finest clothing they possess. The professor
called a carriage, and soon they were rolling down
the broad highway.</p>

<p>“How foolish Hockley is,” whispered Frank to
Mark. “He doesn’t know what he is missing. Do
you think he’ll really go to bed?”</p>

<p>Mark shrugged his shoulders. “It isn’t likely.
He’ll read another trashy novel, I fancy.”</p>

<p>Mark was right, as we already know. But this
was not the depth of Hockley’s shortcomings.</p>

<p>The youth had a strong desire to be considered
“mannish.” He wanted to follow in the footsteps
of certain men he had known and others he had read
about. The character of Handsome Jack, “the
Dead Game Sport of Chicago,” appealed strongly
to him. Jack played cards, drank, went to horse<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
races, and always got the best of the many enemies
who tried to “down” him. To poor Hockley, who
swallowed these tales and believed them true, he was
more of a hero than even “Gold Nose Hank, the
Mine Discoverer” had been.</p>

<p>Having seen the others off, Hockley strolled over
to a cigar counter in the hotel and invested in a
package of cigarettes, one of which he lit and placed
the others in his pocket. Then he entered the café
and called for a glass of liquor, and while it was
coming he sat down at a table in a corner to continue
the perusal of his novel.</p>

<p>The fumes of the liquor, and the smoking of several
cigarettes, made the misguided youth far from
clear headed. But he kept on reading until the
volume was finished, Handsome Jack having at last
killed off all his enemies in double-quick order. To
keep the eyes of the waiter off of him, Hockley
ordered another glass of liquor which he also consumed.
Then he threw the book in a corner, arose
and stretched himself.</p>

<p>“Guess I’ll go out and have some sport,” he muttered.
“It’s dead slow hanging around like this.
I came to see the sights and I’m going to see ’em—professor
or no professor. There must be lots of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
sport going on in a town of this size,—variety
shows, gambling, and such—and I’m going to hunt
’em up, and if I don’t find ’em then my name ain’t
Jake Hockley!”</p>

<p>And paying the amount of his bill he shuffled out
of the brilliantly lighted café and was soon lost to
sight in the darkness of the night.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IX<br>

<small>THE DISAPPEARANCE OF HOCKLEY</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">What</span> a truly magnificent place!”</p>

<p>Such was Frank’s comment when they entered the
opera house and took the seats Professor Strong had
purchased. Frank had been to the Metropolitan
Opera House in New York city, yet the present
place struck him even more favorably, with its immense
size, its gorgeous decorations and its many
and varied lights.</p>

<p>“It’s all right,” returned Mark. “But I can’t
say as much for the crowd. It’s quite a mixture.”</p>

<p>And it certainly was, for to-day Havana has a
sprinkling of nearly every nation under the sun. As
Darry put it, there were white folks there and black
folks, and a good many who weren’t one or the
other. But all were well dressed, and in the assemblage
were a number of ladies who were truly
beautiful.</p>

<p>The Shakespearian play was well produced, and
all followed it with interest, although the boys understood<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
but little of what was said. Between the
acts they strolled around and looked into the various
smoking and lounging rooms, and had some soda
water at the refreshment place. Nearly everybody
was smoking and the atmosphere was decidedly
“hazy” in consequence.</p>

<p>“They used to have a curious custom here,” said
the professor. “By paying a little extra you could
go behind the scenes and see how the play looked
from the actor’s standpoint.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’d like to see it that way, once,” answered
Sam. “Especially when they were playing
something with great mechanical effects, like a snow-storm,
a landslide, a waterfall, or a smash-up on a
railroad.”</p>

<p>At last the play was over, and they walked out to
where their carriage was in waiting. A good part
of the crowd lingered, and some went for a stroll in
the cool night air.</p>

<p>“They don’t believe in going to bed early,” was
Mark’s comment. “Well, I don’t blame them, it’s
so nice and cool now and so hot during the middle
of the day.”</p>

<p>It had been arranged that all the boys should
occupy two large rooms, while the professor had a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
smaller room adjoining. As they went in Amos
Strong cautioned them not to disturb Hockley should
the latter be asleep.</p>

<p>“Why, he isn’t here!” exclaimed Mark, who was
the first to look around and make the discovery.</p>

<p>“Isn’t here?” came from the professor.</p>

<p>“No, sir, and the bed hasn’t been disturbed
either.”</p>

<p>At once the professor’s face grew grave, and his
mind went back to a certain night in Caracas when
Hockley had gone off with Dan Markel and lost all
his money. Had the youth been equally misguided
on this occasion?</p>

<p>“I will go below and make inquiries concerning
him,” he said, and left them.</p>

<p>“I’ll wager Glummy has gone and done it again,”
said Frank in a low voice.</p>

<p>“More than likely,” answered Sam. “How
foolish for him if he has! He might have had a
very pleasant evening with us.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Glummy has a big head and thinks he
knows it all,” came from Darry. “Some time he’ll
catch it worse than he did when he went out with
that Markel.”</p>

<p>So the comments of the boys ran on. In the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
meantime Professor Strong had followed up Hockley
from the hotel proper to the café and here learned
that the lad had come in early in the evening for a
package of cigarettes and then gone out on the
street.</p>

<p>“Did he have any liquor?” asked Professor
Strong, sharply.</p>

<p>“I do not think so, señor,” was the reply. This
was a deliberate falsehood, but the proprietor of the
drinking resort did not wish to get himself into any
trouble.</p>

<p>More mystified than ever the professor went out
on the street and looked up and down. He could
see nothing of Hockley, and now the thoroughfares
were becoming gradually deserted.</p>

<p>It must be confessed that Amos Strong was in a
quandary. What had become of his charge he could
not imagine, although he strongly feared that Hockley
had gone off to see the sights and gotten into
some sort of trouble.</p>

<p>“I can learn nothing of him,” said he, on returning
to the rooms assigned the party. “All of you
had better go to bed.”</p>

<p>“And what will you do, Professor?” asked
Mark.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>“I shall try to hunt him up. I cannot go to
rest until I know something about him.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you think it would be better for one of us
to go with you?”</p>

<p>“No, I think I can get along alone.”</p>

<p>Such was Amos Strong’s decision, and he told
them they had better go to bed without delay. Mark
and Frank were willing enough and were soon in
the land of dreams. But Darry and Sam sat by an
open window discussing the situation.</p>

<p>“After his experience with Dan Markel in Caracas
you would think Hockley would turn over a new
leaf,” said Darry. “But he seems bound to be wild,
no matter what the cost.”</p>

<p>“We mustn’t judge too hastily, Darry. It is
barely possible that everything is all right.”</p>

<p>“Or that Glummy has gotten into trouble
through no fault of his own. If he is in trouble, he
will certainly try to put it off on somebody else—he
always does.”</p>

<p>“It must be his nature. He can’t seem to help
it.”</p>

<p>“He doesn’t try to help it. He wants to be smart,
and when he fails he isn’t man enough to shoulder
the blame.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>For nearly an hour the boys remained at the window
discussing the strange disappearance. Then
they followed Mark and Frank to bed, and were soon
sleeping with equal soundness.</p>

<p>The disappearance of Hockley, coupled with the
fact that Professor Strong did not return, awoke the
lads early, and by seven o’clock Darry and Sam were
downstairs.</p>

<p>“Let us see if the professor is anywhere about,”
suggested Darry, and they were on the point of
moving off when a hotel attendant came up to them,
a man from Florida who spoke English.</p>

<p>“Are you Samuel Winthrop?” he asked.</p>

<p>“I am,” answered Sam.</p>

<p>“I have a private note for you,” went on the attendant.</p>

<p>“A note? What can it mean?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps it’s from the professor?” suggested
Darry.</p>

<p>Sam lost no time in tearing open the communication,
which ran as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Sam</span>: I have got myself in a tight hole
and don’t know how to get myself out of it. I am
afraid the professor will give me rats for getting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
into it. I think you can help me a good deal—in
fact, I know you can, if you will. Please come to
me at the Fairfax House—an English hotel. If
you bring anybody along let it be Darry. I don’t
want the professor to know of it, and please don’t
tell Mark or Frank, for they would only have the
laugh on me. If the professor wants to know, tell
him you want to go on a little private errand. Do
this much for me and I will always be,</p>

<p class="right"><span class="indentright">“Yours gratefully,</span><br>

“<span class="smcap">J. Hockley</span>.”</p>
</div>

<p>“Well, what do you make of that?” asked
Sam, as he passed the note over to his companion.</p>

<p>“Glummy is in some sort of fix, that’s certain,”
answered Darry, after reading the communication
twice.</p>

<p>“He doesn’t say anything about money. I wonder
what the fix can be?”</p>

<p>Neither could imagine, but Sam determined to
go to the Fairfax House without delay, and inside
of two minutes both were on the way, without leaving
word of their destination.</p>

<p>It was an easy matter to find the hostelry named,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
although to walk there took longer than they had
expected, for the Fairfax House was situated in a
new section of Havana and well toward the outskirts.
It was a modest, well-kept hotel, and on
seeing this the boys felt relieved.</p>

<p>“Looks all right,” was Sam’s comment. “Glad
it isn’t the other kind.”</p>

<p>There was an old Cuban <i>volante</i> driver standing
in front of the hotel, and as they came up he accosted
them in broken English.</p>

<p>“Pardon, señors,” he said. “Be you de gen’men
by de name Winthrop or de name Carane?”</p>

<p>“Yes, my name is Winthrop,” answered Sam.
“And this is Mr. Crane.”</p>

<p>“Dat is verra fortunate, señors. You come to
see Señor Hockley, not so?”</p>

<p>“We did? Is he here?”</p>

<p>“He no here now. He had to go to udder house.
He send me here to drive you dare, señors,” and
the Cuban bowed low.</p>

<p>“To drive to another house?” queried Darry.</p>

<p>“Yes, Señor Carane. Dare is my volante.
Please to step in, señors.”</p>

<p>“Wait.” Sam caught Darry by the arm. “Is
it far?” he questioned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>“Not verra far, señor—verra nice drive dis
a-morning.”</p>

<p>“What is the matter with our friend, Mr.
Hockley?”</p>

<p>At this the Cuban shrugged his shoulders. “Cannot
tell, señor. He is hurt in de back, I t’ink.”</p>

<p>“Hurt in the back!” came from both Sam and
Darry.</p>

<p>“That looks bad,” continued the former. “Let
us go to him by all means.” And he followed the
Cuban to the <i>volante</i>.</p>

<p>“It’s a wonder Hockley didn’t come straight to
our hotel if he was hurt,” said Darry. “But it’s
just like him. He is as stubborn as an ox when he
wants to be.”</p>

<p>In Cuba the <i>volante</i>, or “flyer” is the national
carriage. It is a two-seated vehicle, slung on
leathern straps between two very high wheels. The
shafts are fifteen feet long, and the horses are harnessed
tandem, the leader being for the postillion,
or driver. It makes a very comfortable turnout and,
because of the width from wheel to wheel, such a
thing as a volante turning over is unknown.</p>

<p>They were soon moving over the highway at a
good rate of speed. The Cuban offered no more explanations<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
and merely shrugged his shoulders when
questioned.</p>

<p>“Either he is very dumb or he doesn’t wish to
explain,” whispered Darry.</p>

<p>“I don’t suppose Glummy told him everything,
Darry. Perhaps the poor fellow is hurt too much
for that.”</p>

<p>“He can’t be so badly off, or he wouldn’t have
been able to write that letter. By the way, what
did you do with it?”</p>

<p>“Tore it up.”</p>

<p>They were now passing several private residences
and a moment later turned into a road which seemed
almost deserted. Here the trees grew so low down
that they frequently brushed the boys’ heads.</p>

<p>“How much further?” demanded Sam.</p>

<p>“We come dare soon,” shouted back the Cuban,
and whipped up his horses harder than ever.</p>

<p>There was a small brook to cross and then they
turned into another side road. Here they beheld an
old stone building, which looked somewhat like a
deserted convent. The windows were barred, but
the doorway stood open.</p>

<p>“He in dare, señors,” said the <i>volante</i> driver.
“He have a fall not far from here.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>The Cuban pointed to the old stone building.</p>

<p>“I don’t understand this,” muttered Sam. “First
he said that Hockley had to go to ‘udder house.’
Now he said he had a fall here.”</p>

<p>“Come on, I’m not afraid, Sam.”</p>

<p>So speaking Darry walked through the open doorway
into the stone building. There being nothing
else to do, Sam followed, and the <i>volante</i> driver
came after the pair.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER X<br>

<small>THE OLD CONVENT</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">At</span> first both boys could see but little, for the
room they had entered was semi-dark, while outside
the sun was shining brightly. But gradually their
eyes became accustomed to the gloom and then they
made out a staircase running to a floor above.</p>

<p>“Where is he?” demanded Sam, catching the
<i>volante</i> driver by the arm.</p>

<p>“Him up de stairs, señor. Better air up dare.”</p>

<p>“I should hope so,” muttered Darry and bounded
up the stone steps two at a time. Sam came on his
heels, but the Cuban remained below.</p>

<p>There was something of a hallway, dirty and covered
with dead leaves which past storms had blown
into the barred slits of windows. Then came a room
with an iron door which stood half open.</p>

<p>Just then a moan reached their ears and it appeared
to come from the room. Thinking Hockley
must be within they rushed past the iron door.</p>

<p>“Jake, are you here?” called out Sam.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>There was another moan, but where it came from
puzzled both of the lads.</p>

<p>“Jake, where are you?” exclaimed Darry. “We
are here to help you, Sam and I.”</p>

<p>Both moved forward, peering eagerly to the
right and the left. There were only two windows,
each heavily barred, and they were far from
large.</p>

<p>Suddenly the boys heard the iron door shut and
an instant later a heavy bolt was slipped into place.
Sam leaped back and shook the barrier, to find it
fast.</p>

<p>“We are locked in!” he ejaculated. “Darry,
this is a trick!”</p>

<p>“A trick!” gasped the other. He too shook the
door. “Hi! let us out!” he called.</p>

<p>“Not just yet, my fine young fellows!” came in
a strangely familiar voice. “I did not bring you
as far as this just for fun.”</p>

<p>“Why, it is Captain Sudlip!” exclaimed Sam,
who could scarcely believe his ears.</p>

<p>“Captain Sudlip, is that you?” called Darry.</p>

<p>“It is.”</p>

<p>“Where is Jake Hockley?”</p>

<p>“He is not far off.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>“Is he really hurt, or was it only a trick to get
us here?”</p>

<p>“I’m not answering all your questions just yet,”
returned the ex-master of the <i>Chester</i>, tartly.</p>

<p>“If you brought us here on a fool’s errand you
shall pay for it,” said Sam.</p>

<p>“You had better not threaten me while you are
prisoners.”</p>

<p>“Prisoners!” came from both.</p>

<p>“Do you intend to keep us prisoners?” demanded
Sam.</p>

<p>“For the present, yes.”</p>

<p>“What for?”</p>

<p>“To pay you back for your impudence on board
of my steamer, for one thing.”</p>

<p>“We weren’t impudent. We merely stood up
for our rights, and for the rights of that negro you
misused.”</p>

<p>“I won’t argue the point with you—at least not
now.”</p>

<p>“What are you going to do?”</p>

<p>“Going to get back my rights. I know all about
that paper your crowd gave to my second mate.
That paper was a mess of lies and I’m not going to
stand for it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>“We simply put down the truth, Captain Sudlip,”
answered Sam, firmly. “And if you don’t let us
go at once you’ll get yourself into a worse situation
than ever.”</p>

<p>“I can’t get into a much worse fix,” growled the
ex-ship’s captain. “I’ve lost my position and without
a recommendation, too. If I can’t get it back
through your crowd I’m going to make you pay for
it. Reckon that professor of yours has considerable
money, hasn’t he?” went on Jason Sudlip, craftily.</p>

<p>“If he has you’ll never get any of it,” answered
Darry, quickly. “I’d rot here first before I’d let him
give you any on my account.”</p>

<p>“And I say the same,” came from Sam.</p>

<p>“Reckon you’ll both sing a different tune when
you are good and hungry,” retorted the captain, but
it was plain to tell by this tone that this was not exactly
the reply he had anticipated.</p>

<p>“Will you tell us where Hockley is?” went on
Sam, after a painful pause.</p>

<p>“He is not a million miles from here.”</p>

<p>“Is he a prisoner, too?”</p>

<p>“I won’t tell you.”</p>

<p>“How did he come to write that note?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>“I won’t tell you that either.”</p>

<p>The boys could now hear the <i>volante</i> driver calling
up from below, and a moment later they heard the
captain move along the hall and descend the stone
stairs.</p>

<p>“Well, this is a pickle and no mistake,” grumbled
Darry, when they found themselves alone. “What
do you make of it?”</p>

<p>“I hardly know what to make of it, so far,” was
the slow answer. “For all we know, Hockley has
turned traitor to our crowd and is in with the
captain.”</p>

<p>“Do you think he is as bad as that?”</p>

<p>“If he isn’t, how did he come to write that note?”</p>

<p>“That’s true. But I shouldn’t think it, even of
Hockley. Ever since we saved him from that boa constrictor
he has acted pretty decently, for him.”</p>

<p>They moved over to the windows, to see if they
could catch sight of the captain or the <i>volante</i>. At
first they saw nothing, but presently they caught a
flying glimpse.</p>

<p>“There go the both of them!” cried Sam.
“Darry, we have been left to our fate.”</p>

<p>“Glummy wasn’t with them.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>“No.”</p>

<p>“I wonder what Professor Strong will say when
he finds we, too, are missing?”</p>

<p>“He’ll be very much worried, no doubt of that.
Perhaps he’ll set the police on the track. I’d like to
know if he found out anything about Glummy.”</p>

<p>They did not intend to remain prisoners if they
could help it, and so set to work immediately, exploring
every nook and corner of the room, which
was large and built in the shape of the letter L.</p>

<p>“I don’t see any way out, excepting by way of the
iron door, and that’s as fast as can be,” said Sam,
after an hour had passed.</p>

<p>“Excepting we can pry off the bars from one of
the windows.”</p>

<p>“Even if you did that, how are you going to get
to the ground? It’s a good eighteen or twenty feet.
If you dropped that far on those stones you might
break a leg.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’d risk a drop. Besides, we can make a rope
by tearing up a shirt, or one of our jackets. Anything
to get away, to my way of thinking.”</p>

<p>They examined the various bars to the windows
and began operations on one which looked to be
more loose than the others. But though they worked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
with a will on the mortar with their pocket-knives,
the stuff was hard and defied all their efforts.</p>

<p>“We ought to have one of Hockley’s dime novel
heroes here,” said Sam, grimly. “He’d twist this
bar out in a jiffy.”</p>

<p>“Or one of the half-dime novel detectives,” returned
Darry. “He’d find a secret passageway leading
down into a counterfeiter’s den, with a trunk
full of gold in the bargain.”</p>

<p>“Well, this is no laughing matter, Darry. That
ride made me hungry. If I had known this I’d had
breakfast before I started.”</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed, and I’d have packed a big lunch box
in the bargain, Beans. But don’t mention food—it
only makes me more hungry. Let’s take another
look around.”</p>

<p>“Bound to find that passageway to the counterfeiter’s
den, eh? All right, Old Flashlight, go ahead
and make yourself famous.”</p>

<p>Both boys laughed in spite of the seriousness of
the situation, and then began another hunt around
the room.</p>

<p>“I see something that I didn’t notice before,” observed
Darry, after searching around for quarter
of an hour. “Do you see this wall? Right above<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
my reach it is depressed for about a foot. If you’ll
boost me up to the ledge I’ll feel around there for an
opening.”</p>

<p>“To be sure I’ll boost you up. But don’t fall and
hurt yourself.”</p>

<p>Once up on the ledge, Darry felt around with care.
As before, he found plenty of dirt and mixed in with
this were two or three musty books, a couple of
empty bottles, and other odds and ends of no value
whatever.</p>

<p>“Here’s some reading for you—it will help to
pass the idle hours,” cried Darry, tossing the books
to Sam.</p>

<p>“They are Spanish prayer books,” said Sam, examining
them by the light of one of the windows.
“They are dated fifty and sixty years back.”</p>

<p>“I thought I had struck rare volumes worth a few
thousand dollars,” returned Darry, dryly. “Too
bad! Old Flashlight must renew his wondrous
search! If we only—hullo!”</p>

<p>Darry broke off short and Sam heard the creaking
of rusty iron.</p>

<p>“What have you discovered now?” he asked, after
an anxious pause.</p>

<p>“Discovered a door, as sure as you live!” exclaimed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
Darry, and now he was quite excited.
“Hurrah, it’s daylight!”</p>

<p>He had pushed in a small iron door and true
enough both could see a streak of sunlight beyond,
streaming into a small stone passageway. In the
passageway was an iron ladder, leading to the flat
roof of the building. There was a trap door above,
which the storms of years had moved several inches
out of place.</p>

<p>It did not take Darry long to give Sam a hand up
to the ledge, and then both boys entered the little
passageway and crawled up the iron ladder. The
trap door was thrown open and they came up onto
the flat roof of the building. Near at hand was a
sloping roof and also a square tower, all much dilapidated
and covered in spots with heavy trailing
vines.</p>

<p>“So far so good,” exclaimed Darry, as he walked
over to examine the tower. “Now if we can only
get to the ground from here we’ll be all right.”</p>

<p>“There must be another stairway to the lower
floor, Darry.”</p>

<p>“To be sure, and it’s likely in the tower. Come
on.”</p>

<p>Without much difficulty they crawled to the tower<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
in question. Here they found another trap door,
but it was tightly fastened and although they did
their best they could not budge it.</p>

<p>“Stumped again,” grumbled Darry. “Did you
ever see such luck?”</p>

<p>“I know what I’m going to do!” exclaimed Sam,
suddenly. “I’m going to climb down on the vines.
I am sure they are strong enough.”</p>

<p>“Just the thing! Why didn’t we think of it
before.”</p>

<p>They ran over to the edge of the tower and began
to test the vines. Then Sam let himself down a few
feet and Darry did the same. Soon they were moving
downward, slowly and cautiously.</p>

<p>“There goes that volante again!” cried Darry,
presently. “But it didn’t have the captain in it.”</p>

<p>“Let us get away as quickly as we can,” came
from Sam. “If we don’t we may run into more
trouble.”</p>

<p>“Hi, you boys, come back here!” was the cry
which reached their ears. “Come back, I say!”</p>

<p>In amazement, both looked up. There on the
tower stood Captain Sudlip, shaking his fist at them!</p>

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XI<br>

<small>A STRANGE STORY</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was plain to see that Captain Jason Sudlip was
as much surprised as were Sam and Darry. He had
returned in the <i>volante</i> expecting to find the two
prisoners just where he had left them. Seeing them
thus escaping upset all of his calculations.</p>

<p>“Come back here, I say!” he stormed. “Come
back!”</p>

<p>“Not much!” replied Darry. “If you want us,
crawl down after us.”</p>

<p>“Don’t tell him that!” put in Sam, in a whisper.
“He’ll go below and try to cut us off.”</p>

<p>“Are you coming back?” demanded the ex-master
of the <i>Chester</i>.</p>

<p>“Wait a minute until I unloosen my jacket,” returned
Sam. “It’s caught fast on a vine.”</p>

<p>“Gracious, you’re not going back, are you?”
whispered Darry, in dismay.</p>

<p>“No—we’ll fool him,” said Sam, in a still lower
voice. Then he continued aloud: “We may as well
give in, Darry, he’s got the best of us.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>“I hate to do it, but I’ll follow you,” answered
Darry, also in a loud voice. “Will you climb up
first?”</p>

<p>“Yes. But I’m caught fast. Wait till I cut that
vine loose.”</p>

<p>This talk reached Captain Sudlip’s ears—as it was
intended it should—and his wrathful look gave place
to a grim smile.</p>

<p>“Thought I’d make ’em knuckle under,” he muttered.</p>

<p>In the meantime Sam and Darry continued to
climb down with all speed. It was hard for Captain
Sudlip to look down at them but he felt the vines
moving. He waited a few seconds. Then he heard
a dull thud as both boys dropped to the ground
below.</p>

<p>“Hi! you!” he yelled, and his face changed instantly.
“Aren’t you coming up? Well, I’ll be
jiggered!”</p>

<p>For at that moment he caught sight of the two
boys, hurrying down the road leading away from the
old convent. They were going at their best rate of
speed and soon disappeared from view.</p>

<p>“Lost ’em!” he muttered and shook his fist in impotent
rage. “First one and now two. I must get<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
out of here. This spot will soon be too hot to hold
me!”</p>

<p>In the meantime the boys had made good their escape,
with no injury excepting half a dozen scratches
from the rough vines and the convent wall. On
striking the ground their one thought had been to
put distance between themselves and their enemy,
and they ran a good way before they dropped into
a walk.</p>

<p>“That was an adventure truly,” puffed Darry.
“Wonder what Professor Strong will say when he
hears of it.”</p>

<p>“We ought to have Captain Sudlip locked up,
Darry. Besides we don’t know yet what has become
of Hockley.”</p>

<p>“That’s true. What do you propose?”</p>

<p>Both boys stopped short, to give the situation consideration.</p>

<p>“Let us stop at the first house we come to. Perhaps
we can get help there. If we go all the way
back to the hotel it will give the captain an elegant
chance to clear out.”</p>

<p>“All right, Beans, the next house it is,” answered
Darry.</p>

<p>It was not long after this that they came in sight<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
of a beautiful villa, set in a mass of tropical flowers.
There was an avenue of palms leading up to the front
veranda and at one side a beautiful fountain of
marble.</p>

<p>On the veranda they found a young lady, sitting in
a hammock reading a novel. She received them
politely and they were glad to learn that she spoke
excellent English.</p>

<p>“Papa is not at home at present,” she said. “He
left last week to go to Key West, Florida, on business.
Is there anything I can do for you?”</p>

<p>A long conversation ensued, and the boys learned
that the young lady’s name was Isabel Valois. Her
father was a tobacco exporter and owned large
plantations both in Cuba and in Porto Rico. She
had been educated in a private seminary in Havana,
but had spent two years at a young lady’s school in
the United States. She listened to their tale with
close attention and a face full of concern.</p>

<p>“I think I saw Captain Sudlip drive past yesterday
in the <i>volante</i> of which you speak. And late last
night I heard somebody drive past at a furious rate
of speed. I am willing to help you all I can, but
there are at present only three old servants here and
one has to look after my mamma, who is an invalid.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
Perhaps it would be best for you to take our carriage
and drive back to town or to some other house for
assistance.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, we’ll take the carriage, if you don’t
mind. Have you somebody to drive it and show the
way?”</p>

<p>“Yes—myself,” and she laughed merrily. “The
adventure will just suit me. While old Jose is harnessing
up you shall have breakfast.”</p>

<p>As both were tremendously hungry they could not
resist this invitation, and soon they were seated in a
broad and cool dining hall and eating the food which
was hastily prepared for them. The meal did not
take long and by the time it was over Isabel Valois
drove around with a comfortable carriage of American
manufacture. They climbed in, there was a
merry crack of the whip, and off they started in the
direction of Havana proper.</p>

<p>Had their minds been at ease, Sam and Darry
would have enjoyed that ride thoroughly, for Isabel
Valois handled the reins with skill, and the team was
a spirited one. She was what Darry called a “jolly”
girl, and as they passed along she entertained them
with a bright flow of talk, as she pointed out many
objects of interest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>“I like the people from the United States,” she
said, archly. “And I was so disappointed when
Cuba was not taken into the Union. But papa says
it is bound to come sooner or later.”</p>

<p>“And it will,” answered Sam. “But tell me,” he
went on, “were you at home when Havana was
blockaded?”</p>

<p>“To be sure I was, and many were scared
to death, for fear the big guns on the warships
would bombard our homes. Once, when
a wild shot did come this way, all the servants
ran down into our cellar and hid in a
corner.”</p>

<p>“And weren’t you scared?” asked Darry, with a
twinkle in his eye.</p>

<p>“No, I was not. I knew the Americans were our
friends and would not hurt us.”</p>

<p>“I am afraid we hurt some Cubans down at
Santiago.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that was different. Here it was only a
blockade—that was a direct attack.”</p>

<p>The drive into the city of Havana took them past
the Fairfax House, and here the boys determined to
stop and learn if anything had been seen or heard
of Hockley.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>They had just leaped to the pavement when Professor
Strong ran forward to meet them.</p>

<p>“Crane and Winthrop!” he ejaculated. “What
does this mean?”</p>

<p>“It’s a long story, sir,” answered Sam. “Have
you seen anything of Hockley?”</p>

<p>“No. I was looking for him the best part of the
night and also for you, after I learned that you, too,
were missing. I traced Hockley and you to this
hotel by the note which you tore up and which Mark
and Frank patched together. Did you follow
Hockley up?”</p>

<p>“We don’t know,” answered Darry, and continued
soberly: “It looks as if poor Glum—I mean
Jake—had met with foul play.”</p>

<p>Isabel Valois was introduced, and the discovery
was made that Professor Strong had met her father
years before. Then the two boys told their story.
As they proceeded Amos Strong’s face grew dark.</p>

<p>“This Captain Sudlip is a scoundrel!” he murmured.
“We shall have to notify the police. He
has been discharged from the command of the
<i>Chester</i>, and it has made him vindictive.”</p>

<p>“So he has lost command of the steamer?” asked
Darry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>“Yes. The owners were very angry that he did
not have those repairs made at La Guayra, where
they would have been cheaper, it seems, than here.
Then they read the note that we signed, and Captain
Sudlip got his walking papers. I heard afterward
that the owners were tired of him as it was. But of
course he lays the blame of his discharge on us. We
may have to——”</p>

<p>“Here comes Hockley!” broke in Darry.</p>

<p>He pointed up the street and all looked in that direction.
It was the lank youth sure enough, but so
haggard, ragged and dirty that they scarcely recognized
him. He did not see them until he was close
at hand and then he started and flushed guiltily.</p>

<p>“Hockley, what does this mean?” demanded Professor
Strong, but his voice was not particularly
harsh, for he saw that the big youth had suffered.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m so glad to get back,” said the truant,
when he could speak. “I’m nearly dead, sir.”</p>

<p>“Where have you been?”</p>

<p>“It’s all that Captain Sudlip’s fault, sir. He got
me in a regular box,” whined Hockley. Then he
looked at Sam and Darry. “I thought he—he carried
you off, too.”</p>

<p>“He didn’t carry us off. We tried to follow you,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
after you wrote that you were in trouble and wanted
us to come.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t write any such note.”</p>

<p>“You didn’t!” burst out Sam and Darry, simultaneously.</p>

<p>“No, I didn’t. I wrote a note for Captain Sudlip,
but it wasn’t that.”</p>

<p>“What was it?”</p>

<p>At first Hockley did not want to answer this question,
but he finally admitted that he had written
a note stating that Captain Sudlip had treated him
first-class while on the <i>Chester</i> and that he was satisfied
the captain was a good man. He did not add
that he had also written that there was a plot against
the captain, hatched out, shortly after leaving Kingston
harbor, by Professor Strong, and the second
mate.</p>

<p>“I had to write the note. The captain had me a
prisoner and he threatened me in all sorts of ways,”
concluded Hockley.</p>

<p>Again there was a conference, and it was decided
that they no longer needed the services of Isabel
Valois, although the young lady said she would place
her carriage at their disposal as long as they wished
it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>“You must surely call on me before you leave
Havana,” said she. “I wish to hear the end of this
adventure,” and Sam and Darry promised.</p>

<p>On the way to the hotel at which the party were
stopping Hockley told his story in detail only leaving
out the fact that he had been drinking and that
when he left the café it had been with the intention
of seeking amusement at some low theater.</p>

<p>“I thought I’d take a walk and try to get rid of
my headache,” he said. “I walked further than I
intended, and when I was on something of a lonely
street I noticed that I was being followed. It was
Captain Sudlip, and behind him came a Cuban who
was driving one of those <i>volantes</i>. The captain came
up to me and started to talk. He was very friendly
and humble and said if he lost his job he wouldn’t
know where to look for another. Then he asked
me to ride over to the home of one of the owner’s
of the steamer and put in a good word for him, and
I consented.”</p>

<p>Hockley could tell but little of the ride that had
followed, for the reason that his head had been muddled
by the liquor he had imbibed. He put it down
to a headache, and it is quite likely that he did have
a headache.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>“At last we stopped in front of some sort of stone
building,” he continued, “and the captain took me
inside. Then he laughed at me and told me I was a
prisoner. We had a fight and he knocked me down
and tore my clothing as you see. Then he made me
write that letter. He wanted me to write to the
other boys but I refused. After that he left me
alone in the dark. I crawled around until I got to
a barred window. One of the bars was loose and I
pulled it out and crawled through the window. Then
I started to run across a field but fell into a hole and
struck my head on a stone. I don’t know how long
I lay there. But when I got up it was light, and
then I started to walk back into town, for I hadn’t a
cent left with which to hire a carriage.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XII<br>

<small>ABOUT CUBA AND TOBACCO RAISING</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">By</span> the time Hockley had finished his story the
party had reached the hotel, where Mark and Frank
were found, wondering what was going on. They
still had the pieces of the torn-up note in their possession,
and now it was noticed that it was written in
a crude imitation of Hockley’s handwriting.</p>

<p>“Jake, we owe you an apology for having thought
you wrote that,” said Sam, frankly.</p>

<p>“Yes,” put in Darry. “We owe you an apology
true enough. I guess you were locked up in the
same old convent we were in,” he went on.</p>

<p>“I am going to proceed against Captain Sudlip
without delay,” said Professor Strong. “We have
a strong case against him and he shall suffer for his
misdeeds.”</p>

<p>But though the professor spoke thus, to proceed
was no easy matter. When the old convent was
visited no trace of the ex-master of the <i>Chester</i> was
to be found, nor could his whereabouts be traced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
from the Fairfax House. The Cuban who had
driven the <i>volante</i> had likewise disappeared.</p>

<p>“Stumped!” said Darry, laconically. “He
knows enough to keep shady. He won’t show himself
until after we are gone, and neither will that
rascally Cuban.”</p>

<p>Owing to what had occurred, it was resolved to
remain in Havana for the balance of the week, and
during the next few days all the boys spent a large
part of their time in sight-seeing. They inspected
Morro Castle, and a guide explained how it had
been fortified during the Spanish-American War,
and they also visited some of the other fortifications.
Next came a trip to the post-office, treasury building,
the military offices and the cathedral. At the
latter place they were shown an urn said to contain
the bones of Columbus.</p>

<p>“Are they really his bones?” asked Mark.</p>

<p>“More than likely,” answered Professor Strong.
“Yet this statement has often been disputed. Some
say the bones are in Spain and others that they are
in South America. It matters little where his bones
lie. The fame of Columbus will ever remain the
same.”</p>

<p>After the visit to the cathedral came another to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
the public art gallery, and the museum, and they also
visited both the Cuban and the English cemeteries,
beautiful spots, with many tall and imposing monuments.
They also drove out to Principe Castle and
spent two days at other points in the suburbs.</p>

<p>A railroad runs from Havana, south-westward to
Pinar del Rio, a distance of about a hundred miles,
and it was decided that one day should be spent at
this city, the most important in the extreme western
section of Cuba. This railroad was formerly of
small importance but since the dawn of Cuban liberty,
matters have taken a brisker turn.</p>

<p>“They had the same trouble here that they are
having in South America,” said the professor, during
the journey. “The natives do not take to the
cars, no matter how low the fare. They prefer to
journey on muleback or on foot, even though it takes
much longer.”</p>

<p>“What a difference between that and our own
country,” said Frank, with a laugh. “Just let a
railroad lop off an hour from the running time between
New York and Chicago, or between Chicago
and San Francisco, and everybody runs to ride on
that railroad.” And then all laughed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>“How large is Cuba?” asked Darry. “I did
know, but I stored the knowledge away so carefully
that I’ve forgotten where I put it.”</p>

<p>“Cuba is, roughly speaking, over seven hundred
miles from east to west, and from fifty to a hundred
miles from north to south. It contains nearly forty-four
thousand square miles of territory, but a large
portion of this is either very rocky, as in the mountains,
or else very marshy, as along the seacoast.
There is a mountain range running almost the entire
length of the island. It is called the Sierra del
Cobra, and boasts of one peak, the Pico de Torginno,
7,670 feet high. Besides this range of mountains
there are numerous hills, particularly in the east.”</p>

<p>“What of the rivers?” asked Frank.</p>

<p>“As in Jamaica the rivers do not amount to a great
deal, for the water flows directly from the mountains
into the sea. There is one, called the Cauto, which
empties on the south coast, just north of Manzanillo.
This can be navigated by small craft for a distance
of sixty miles. But there are a number of bays
which make good harbors. The one at Santiago de
Cuba is particularly fine.”</p>

<p>“Where the great fight came off, and where Hobson<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
sunk the <i>Merrimac</i>!” cried Sam. “We must
see that by all means. I once saw the <i>Merrimac</i>, but
she was only a coal boat at that time.”</p>

<p>“The <i>Monitor</i> sunk the <i>Merrimac</i>,” came from
Hockley, who was half asleep in his seat. And then
as the other boys began to laugh he straightened up.
“What are you laughing at anyway?” he growled.
“I know I’m right.”</p>

<p>“We are talking about the Spanish-American
War, not the Civil War,” explained the professor.</p>

<p>“Oh!”</p>

<p>“There are only two great industries in Cuba,”
went on Professor Strong. “But some day there
will be a third. The two are tobacco and sugar.
They dominate trade and have made many Spaniards
and Cubans rich. The town we are now bound
for, Pinar del Rio, is the center of trade of the
Vuelta Abajo tobacco district. The folks for miles
around do nothing but raise tobacco.”</p>

<p>“And what will that third industry be?” asked
Darry.</p>

<p>“The development of the mineral resources of the
island. There are large quantities of minerals in the
mountains, and sooner or later companies will be organized
to dig them out. The very name of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
mountain, Sierra del Cobra, means Copper Mountains.”</p>

<p>“I’d like to explore those mountains,” said Mark.
“It would be lots of fun to peep down into an extinct
volcano or two.”</p>

<p>“We can do that when we get to other places,
Mark. South America is full of old volcanoes.”</p>

<p>“That’s the talk!” cried Frank, enthusiastically.
“We’ll become volcano explorers. It will be fine.
Who knows but that we may find a fortune in gold.”</p>

<p>The ride to Pinar del Rio soon came to an end.
The boys were somewhat disappointed in the town,
which boasts of about nine thousand inhabitants.
There are but few public buildings of note and everything
looked rather hot and dusty. But the tobacco
warehouses were something new to them, and the
professor had a Cuban who could speak English
take them around.</p>

<p>“Tobacco is grown in various ways in different
countries,” said the professor, as they walked
around. “But the usual method, and the easiest, is
to plant the seed in a specially prepared garden, or
hot-house frame. As soon as it is up a few inches
the plants are taken to the field and each is set out on
its own little hill. Plants, to be good, require constant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
care, especially against the insects, that would
otherwise eat holes in the leaves and render them of
small value.</p>

<p>“When the leaves are full grown the plant is cut
down and the leaves are hung up, ends down, to dry.
From this drying process they are taken to the curing
shed where they are thoroughly cured, after which
they are ready for packing, in hogsheads or large
cases. How they make cigars you saw down in Venezuela.”</p>

<p>“My father frequently has cigars that are all
spotted,” said Mark. “What do the spots come
from?”</p>

<p>“If they are genuine they come from a gum in
the leaf, which appears on the surface when the leaf
is fully ripe. But many of the spots—which some
smokers look for—are put on artificially.”</p>

<p>“What about smoking tobacco and snuff?” asked
Darry.</p>

<p>“And cigarettes?” put in Hockley.</p>

<p>“Smoking tobaccoes are nothing more than tobacco
leaves cut up in various ways and snuff is
tobacco ground up. The smoking tobaccoes are
flavored with a hundred and one different things and
chemicals are often used to keep them moist, and this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
treatment is also true of chewing tobacco. Some
snuffs are allowed to rot before being used and
others are baked, and many of them are perfumed.
As to cigarettes, the best of them are made of carefully
selected tobacco leaves, cut fine, and rolled up
in a high grade of specially prepared rice paper. But
the ordinary cigarette, of which millions are sold, is
made of the very commonest of tobacco, adulterated
in many ways, and is utterly unfit for smoking.
These cigarettes, often used by boys and young men,
are so utterly bad that even old tobacco-saturated
Cubans—like these working around this warehouse—cannot
use them without feeling sick.”</p>

<p>The last words were uttered for Hockley’s benefit.
The eyes of the tall youth sought the ground and a
moment later he turned away. But it was evident
that he was doing some deep thinking. A little later,
when he felt he was unobserved, he dropped a
half package of cigarettes in an out-of-the-way
corner.</p>

<p>The ride back to Havana in the cool of the evening
was delightful and the boys enjoyed it thoroughly,
that is, all but Hockley, who soon went to
sleep.</p>

<p>“I really can’t see why he came with us,” observed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
Sam to the others, in a low tone. “He
doesn’t seem to enjoy the sight-seeing a bit.”</p>

<p>“He wants something more startling,” answered
Frank. “He told me this morning that everything
was dead slow. He wants more sport. If he had his
way I really believe he’d turn in to paint the town
red, as they call it.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe he told us the whole truth about
his meeting with Captain Sudlip, do you?”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t. I think he went out for a good time
and perhaps he had some liquor.”</p>

<p>“That’s what I was thinking,” came from Mark.
“But as we don’t know we shouldn’t misjudge him.
If he’s got this wildness in his constitution it may be
awfully hard for him to keep even as straight as he
does.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIII<br>

<small>A CUBAN BASEBALL GAME</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">On</span> the following morning the boys spent a good
hour poring over the map of Cuba. It had been decided
that they should go to Matanzas and Cardenas
on the coast east of Havana, and they asked the professor
why they could not continue eastward as far
as Colon and Santa Clara.</p>

<p>“We can if you wish it,” answered Amos
Strong.</p>

<p>“I see there is a railroad runs from Santa Clara
to Cienfuegos on the south coast,” said Mark.
“Why not go to that port? We ought to find some
vessel there bound for Santiago.”</p>

<p>Willing to do what the boys desired, within reasonable
limits, Professor Strong put the matter to a
vote. Four at once voted in favor of Mark’s plan.
Hockley said neither yes nor no.</p>

<p>“How do you vote, Jacob?” asked the professor,
pleasantly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>“What’s the use of my voting?” grumbled the
tall youth. “If I voted the other way it would be
four to one.”</p>

<p>“Have you any objection to Mark’s plan?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, I reckon it’s as good as any. I think the
whole of Cuba rather stale.”</p>

<p>“What did you expect?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I want to see something of life. Do they
have bull fights?”</p>

<p>“Not as they did formerly. But the Cubans are
beginning to play baseball,” and there was a twinkle
in the professor’s eye as he spoke.</p>

<p>“Humph, I can see that at home.”</p>

<p>“Oh, let’s go and see a game!” cried Darry.
“Do you know of any here?”</p>

<p>For reply the professor produced a handbill which
had been given him in the courtyard of the hotel. It
stated that a game of ball would take place that afternoon
on a certain public grounds between the Palmas
of Havana and the Roosevelts of Florida.</p>

<p>“Say, but they are high-toned on names,” was
Frank’s comment. “The President of Cuba against
the President of the United States.”</p>

<p>“Whoop!” cried Darry, throwing his cap into
the air. “Let’s go and root for Teddy!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>“Let’s!” shouted the others, and even Hockley
brightened at the suggestion.</p>

<p>The professor was quite willing to let them go,
feeling that the game would likely give Hockley
something of the excitement he craved. The matter
was soon arranged, and they purchased the best seats
available.</p>

<p>When they reached the public grounds they found
a crowd assembled, and the ball players were already
at practice on the green field. There were several
hundred Americans present, many in carriages, and
among the carriages they discovered the Valois turnout,
with Isabel Valois and a number of other young
people.</p>

<p>“I thought I’d see you here,” declared the young
lady. “No Yankee boy can keep away from a ball
game,” and she smiled as she shook hands and was
introduced to those she had not before met.</p>

<p>Mark was anxious to see the American players
more closely. As we know, he had always been a
good ball player and had been the captain of the
team at Lakeview Academy, beating Hockley for
that position by several votes, much to the bully’s
discomfiture. Now he worked his way through the
crowd close to the American players’ “bench,” in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
this case an awning spread to shade a certain spot
on the grass to the right of the home plate.</p>

<p>The ball players were all about Mark’s age, one or
two a little older, and seemed to be a jolly set. But
as Mark came nearer so did one of the team and his
face wore a serious expression.</p>

<p>“Ronaldson is no better,” Mark heard him tell
the others. “Complains of terrible cramps.”</p>

<p>“Is he going to try to play?” asked one of the
other players.</p>

<p>“Yes, but I don’t know how long he will last.”</p>

<p>“Then you’ll have to use Blackney.”</p>

<p>“I suppose so, but he’s got a sore hand and can’t
half catch. We need a good man on second base.
The Palmas are going to do their best to win this
game.”</p>

<p>The talk interested Mark greatly and it aroused
the baseball fever in his veins. He caught the eye
of one of the players and beckoned to him.</p>

<p>“Are any of you fellows from New York state?”
he asked.</p>

<p>“Yes, Len Gardell is from Rochester,” was the
answer.</p>

<p>“I come from New York city,” went on Mark.
“I’m an old ball player—used to be captain of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
Lakeview Academy nine of New Hampshire. We
once played a team from Rochester—the Silver
Stars. Can I speak to Mr. Gardell? My name is
Mark Robertson.”</p>

<p>“Why, certainly, Mr. Robertson,” said the ball
player, and held out his hand. “My name is Bob
Lee. I’m from Atlanta, Georgia. We put ourselves
down as from Florida for we have been playing there—at
several of the big hotels.”</p>

<p>And a minute later Mark was introduced to all of
the team and made to feel quite at home.</p>

<p>Having finished their chat with Isabel Valois and
her companions, the others made their way to the
stand and found the seats assigned to them. Soon
all of the baseball players were out on the diamond
and the game began with the Cuban team at the bat.</p>

<p>“It’s funny Mark doesn’t come,” said Darry.
“He always thinks so much of a ball game.”</p>

<p>“He went off to see the players,” answered
Frank. He looked toward the “bench.” “I declare
there he is now, talking to one of the substitute
players!”</p>

<p>“Then he’s at home,” laughed Darry. “You
won’t get him back here, unless the umpire drives
him from the field.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>When Hockley saw Mark sitting on the “bench”
he was green with envy.</p>

<p>“Always getting in,” he muttered to himself.
“That’s just the way he got in on me at the academy!
Confound the luck!” And then Hockley
tried to get on the field himself, but was ordered
back by one of the policemen stationed there to keep
the crowd in bounds.</p>

<p>The boys had already learned that this game was
the last of a series of three. Each club had already
won one game. A prize of a silver cup and half of the
gate money were to go to the winner of the series.</p>

<p>At first glance it did not appear as if the Cuban
club could play. They seemed to toss the ball about
in reckless fashion and strike out wildly when at the
bat, yet at the end of the fourth innings the score
was a tie, 3 to 3.</p>

<p>“This game is all right,” was Frank’s comment.
“I’ve seen many a worse one right on the Polo
grounds in New York.”</p>

<p>“Oh, the New Yorks can’t play ball anyway,”
growled Hockley.</p>

<p>In the next innings both clubs scored two runs,
bringing the score up to another tie. There was a
beautiful running catch made by one of the Cuban<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
fielders and this was roundly applauded by the
American as well as the Cuban spectators.</p>

<p>“Give these Cubans a few more years and they’ll
be as crazy for baseball as we are,” said Darry.</p>

<p>In the first half of the sixth innings the Cubans
scored another run. A “pop” fly had been knocked
across the diamond but the second baseman failed to
hold it. As it was a clear muff some in the crowd
groaned, at which the baseman looked more disconcerted
than ever.</p>

<p>“Don’t groan or hiss,” said Professor Strong.
“Every player is bound to miss it sometime. That
baseman did very well before. And he acts to me
as if he was sick. I’ve seen him holding his stomach
several times.”</p>

<p>The Roosevelts now came to the bat with a score
of 6 to 5 against them. The first player up was
put out on strikes and the second on a foul tip. The
third batsman had a ball and a strike called and then
sent a long, high fly to center field.</p>

<p>“Hurrah!” yelled the crowd of Americans.
“That’s a daisy! Run! Run!”</p>

<p>“It’s a home run. Go it, longlegs, go it!”</p>

<p>“Don’t let them stop you at third! You’ve got
lots of time!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>The yelling continued. In the meantime the center
fielder was racing after the ball like mad. He
caught it up just as the runner was leaving third for
the home plate and threw it to the catcher with all
his strength. But it fell short of its mark and was
captured by the pitcher, who whirled around and delivered
it home just as the runner slid in amid a
cloud of dust and a yelling which could be heard for
half a mile. Then those close by saw the catcher
leap for the ball, capture it in one hand and fall in
a heap on top of the man who had slid in to victory.</p>

<p>“He’s safe!” was the cry, as the crowd saw the
umpire keep his hand down. “Oh, wasn’t that a
dandy run!”</p>

<p>“And wasn’t that a dandy hit!”</p>

<p>It was several seconds before the dust cleared
away and then it was seen that something was
wrong. The runner had been kicked in the arm
by the catcher and the latter had tumbled and
bruised his knee. Both had to be helped from
the field and time was called while the hurts
were attended to by a doctor who happened to be
present.</p>

<p>“They say that runner is out of the game,” was
the report which went the round a little later. “And<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
that second baseman has retired too. He’s suffering
from cramps. The catcher is all right.”</p>

<p>“If the Roosevelts lose two men they will be one
man short,” said Sam. “They had only one substitute
at the bench.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps the others are somewhere around,”
answered Darry.</p>

<p>The catcher came limping up and the game was
resumed. But no more runs were made and the
innings came to an end with another tied score,
6 to 6. Then came a long wait.</p>

<p>“I hope they don’t call it off on account of not
having another substitute,” said Frank. And then
he continued: “I wonder where Mark is? He isn’t
down at the bench.”</p>

<p>A minute later the American team came from
their dressing room, where they had been in conference,
and ran to their various positions on the field.</p>

<p>As they did so the boys in the stand gave a cry of
amazement.</p>

<p>“Well, I never!” came from Darry.</p>

<p>“Is it really Mark?” questioned Sam.</p>

<p>“Of course it is!” shouted Frank, leaping to his
feet and swinging his cap. “It’s Mark, and he’s
going to play second base!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIV<br>

<small>WINNING A VICTORY</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Frank</span> was right, one of the two substitute players
to go forth was really Mark, and he had run
across the diamond to fill the important position
mentioned.</p>

<p>The explanation of this state of affairs is very
simple. On being introduced to the player from
Rochester Mark had discovered that he had met the
fellow before, and a long talk on baseball matters
followed. Then Mark was introduced to the captain
of the team, who told of the way they were handicapped
with only one substitute player, two others
having disappointed him, and of the fact that the
second baseman was liable to give out at any
moment.</p>

<p>After the muff already mentioned the second baseman
refused to play longer and had to be excused.
Then came the accident at the home plate and the
team found itself short a man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>“I’ll fill that place,” came from Mark. “I think I
can give satisfaction. Anyway, I’ll try my best.”</p>

<p>“Give him the chance,” came from the Rochester
player, and so it was decided, the captain thinking
he could remove Mark at the end of one innings if
the youth proved “a stick,” as he put it.</p>

<p>It was natural for the boys to give a cheer, and
they did so with a will, even Professor Strong joining
in, for he was almost as enthusiastic as anybody.
Mark heard and saw them and waved his hand. He
had slipped on a player’s suit, as well as a cap and a
pair of baseball shoes and, to use Frank’s words, “he
looked the real thing.”</p>

<p>But there was one in the crowd who did not fancy
the turn affairs had taken. I doubt if there is need
to state that this was Hockley.</p>

<p>“Humph! so he has wormed his way in with
them,” he muttered. “I hope he loses the game.”</p>

<p>The ardor of the Americans among the spectators
was considerably dampened when the two substitutes
appeared. With the score a tie and only three
more innings to play it was felt that the Roosevelts
would have to put forth their very best efforts in
order to win.</p>

<p>The seventh inning was over in remarkably short<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
order. There was but one base hit, made by the Cubans,
and this runner “died” at third. Mark had
next to nothing to do at second, nor did he come to
the bat. But the other substitute came to the plate,
and when he “fanned the air” for three strikes a
deep groan went up.</p>

<p>“The subs are no good! Might as well give up
the game!” cried some of the hasty ones.</p>

<p>In the next inning the Cubans managed by good
luck to score two runs. In this inning Mark might
have put one of the runners out at second, but the
ball was thrown so high up that only his finger tip
touched it. Yet this counted as an error for him and
the other players looked far from pleased.</p>

<p>“I knew it,” muttered Hockley to Sam. “He
can’t play—he isn’t in practice.”</p>

<p>“Jake Hockley, you ought to be ashamed!” retorted
Sam, and then turned his back on the lank
youth.</p>

<p>With the score 8 to 6 in their favor the Palmas
came to the bat for the last time. One man went
out on strikes and the next on a foul. Then came
the third, a heavy-set fellow, who “lined it out”
straight for the pitcher.</p>

<p>It was a “hot” ball, far too hot for that pitcher<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
to take, even in a last inning, and he hardly made a
move for it. But Mark made a leap, and almost before
the spectators realized what was up, he held
the sphere in his left hand and the umpire had called
“out!”</p>

<p>“Hurrah!” yelled Frank. “That’s the stuff!”
And the others followed in a cheer, while Professor
Strong’s face wore a broad smile. This game of ball
made him feel a good deal like a boy again.</p>

<p>“Two runs to tie the score and three to win the
game,” said more than one player of the Roosevelts
as they took their positions at the “bench.” “Oh,
we must get together and do something. We can’t
allow these Cubans to win the series.”</p>

<p>The first player to the bat was the left fielder. He
was usually counted a careful hitter and nobody was
surprised when he reached first base in safety. But
the others were sorry he had not made third, or at
least second.</p>

<p>There followed an out on strikes and aided by a
short passed ball, the runner reached third, taking
desperate chances. Then came a short hit which
took the batter to first by “fielder’s choice,” the ball
being thrown in to cover the home plate. But the
man on third was wise and stayed there.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>“Hilgard to the bat, Robertson on deck!” sang
out the scorer, and Mark’s heart gave a thump. Was
it possible that the result of this game was to depend
upon him?</p>

<p>In another moment he knew, for Hilgard went
out on strikes, amid a mad yelling from the Cubans.
There were now two out, so the whole result of that
contest rested upon Mark’s shoulders.</p>

<p>“You must do it, Mark!” yelled Frank, at the top
of his lungs. “Go in, old boy, and win! Whoop
her up for old Lakeview!” And then the others
took up the cry, that is, all but Hockley, who, true
to his nickname, remained as glum as ever.</p>

<p>When Mark stepped up to the home plate it was
with a determination to “do or die” right then and
there. He grasped the ash stick firmly, planted his
feet and took a good, hard hold of his nerves.</p>

<p>The Cuban pitcher eyed him curiously. He was a
“new proposition” and the pitcher hardly knew
how to handle him. He stepped back, gave the
catcher a sign, and delivered a swift out curve.
Mark let it go by.</p>

<p>“Ball one!” called the umpire.</p>

<p>“That’s right, take your time!” yelled Frank.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
He was standing up and so was everybody else in the
stand.</p>

<p>In came the ball again and this time Mark struck
at it but missed.</p>

<p>“Strike one!”</p>

<p>A loud yelling went up from the Cubans.</p>

<p>Mark took a firmer grip than ever. It must be
confessed that he was in an agony of mind. What
if he should “fan out?” He was certain that club
would never forgive him. And he was equally certain
that he should never forgive himself.</p>

<p>And then came a ball waist high and directly over
the plate, a beautiful ball, and just where Mark
wanted it. Around came the bat in one swift drive.
There was a crack, and the ball went sailing down
into deep center field.</p>

<p>On the instant the crowd in the stand were yelling
like so many demons and Frank was dancing up and
down as if he had suddenly gone crazy. Mark had
reached first—he was already on his way to second,
and still the center fielder was chasing after that ball,
which kept bouncing on and on just out of his reach.
One runner crossed the home plate and the second
followed almost on his heels. The catcher was yelling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
and so was the captain of the Palmas but nobody
heard them. Mark, his breath coming thick and fast
was fairly leaping through the air on his way to
third. Here the baseman made a feint as if to catch
the ball and Mark ducked and slid in to the bag.</p>

<p>“Go on! Go on!” yelled the coach, and a hundred
others, and Mark glanced back, to see that the
fielder was just picking up the ball. How he got to
his feet he never knew, but off he started for home,
amid a yelling that was louder than ever. He came
over like the wind, to sink exhausted near the
“bench,”—and then the ball came in.</p>

<p>The game was won!</p>

<p>“Hurrah for Mark!” Frank fairly screamed, and
made a wild leap into the field, followed by Sam and
Darry, and even the professor, and in another moment
the enclosure was black with people. All the
Americans were shouting loudly, while the Cubans
had but little to say.</p>

<p>“He must be a first-class professional,” said one
Cuban.</p>

<p>“Nothing of the kind,” retorted Frank, who heard
the remark. “He is only an academy player. He
never played on a professional team in his life.”</p>

<p>The players on the Roosevelt nine were not slow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
in congratulating Mark, and had he allowed it they
would have carried him around the field on their
shoulders. But Mark was too modest for this, and
as soon as possible escaped to the dressing room.</p>

<p>“Oh, say, but it was great!” burst out Darry, as
he wrung Mark’s hand. “Better than anything I
ever saw at Lakeview.”</p>

<p>“You fairly lifted the crowd off its feet with that
home run,” put in Sam. “Even the professor was
yelling like a senior.”</p>

<p>“Was I?” the question came from Amos Strong
himself, who stood behind Sam. “Well, I fancy
the game was worth it,” he added, but looked rather
sheepish for a second.</p>

<p>The Roosevelts insisted upon giving Mark a supper
that night (since he had refused to accept part
of the gate money for his services), and a good time
was had until late in the evening. Frank accompanied
Mark, and during that festive hour the lads
made several warm friends.</p>

<p>“But the Cubans played a good game,” observed
Darry, to Sam, while they and Hockley and the professor
were waiting for Mark and Frank to return.
“It was nip-and-tuck from start to finish.”</p>

<p>“That hit by Mark was a fluke,” grumbled Hockley.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
“I’ll bet a thousand dollars he can’t do it
again.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps it was a fluke,” returned Sam, dryly.
“But, just the same, Glummy, you’ll never have such
a fluke happen to you;” and then Sam turned his
back on the bully.</p>

<p>Hockley sauntered off to his sleeping apartment
all out of sorts both with himself and everybody
around him.</p>

<p>“After this they’ll be more stuck on themselves
than ever,” he growled. “And they won’t want anything
to do with me. But never mind, I’ll fix them
yet, see if I don’t!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XV<br>

<small>HOCKLEY TAKES A BATH AND GIVES ONE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">On</span> the following day Professor Strong and the
boys received a call from Isabel Valois and her father,
the latter having just returned home from a
business trip. Señor Valois was delighted to meet
the professor once more, and an interview pleasing
to both ensued, lasting an hour. In the meantime
pretty Isabel talked to the boys and especially to
Mark.</p>

<p>“It was splendid, that baseball hit!” cried the
girl, enthusiastically. “I hated to see our Cuban club
lose but I couldn’t help admire the beautiful way in
which you played.” And Mark blushed like a girl
and could hardly stammer out his thanks for her
kind words.</p>

<p>Señor Valois was telling the professor of his various
plantations when another visitor was announced.
This proved to be January Jones, who had been
waiting patiently to see Amos Strong about the position
which had been more than half promised. As<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
a result of this visit January was given work as
overseer’s assistant on a Valois’s plantation ten miles
out of Havana. This proved to be just what the
darkey wanted and he was correspondingly happy.</p>

<p>Matanzas lies east of Havana about sixty miles
and Cardenas is about twenty miles further. As
said before, both are seaports, the first named lying
almost due south from Key West. The railroad
from Havana runs direct to Matanzas, but to get
to Cardenas one must journey first to the little
inland town of Jovellanos.</p>

<p>The trip eastward was begun bright and early
on the following week and proved full of interest.
The cars were crowded and the boys noticed that
many of the travelers seemed well-to-do.</p>

<p>“Matanzas is, as a commercial city, next in importance
to Havana,” said the professor as they
rode along. “It has a large shipping and the population
is nearly forty thousand. Not far from the
city are located the Caves of Bellamar. I never
visited them, but they are said to be of uncommon
interest and beauty.”</p>

<p>“Let us go by all means!” cried Darry. “I
just love caves and volcanoes and high mountains.”</p>

<p>Matanzas was reached in the middle of the forenoon,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
and before dining they paid a visit to the fortifications
which had taken active part in the war, and
also to a number of public buildings. Then they
dined, and after that set out for the caves on muleback,
along with a native guide, who owned the
mules and who said he could take them around to
every point of interest.</p>

<p>The mule he rode interested Darry very much,
for, as old readers know, he took naturally to any
animal that could be saddled. The mule was not
very large, but he looked powerful and his gait
proved a surprise.</p>

<p>“I really believe he could win a race on a pinch!”
said Darry.</p>

<p>“Do you?” queried Hockley. “I’ll go you for
a mile.”</p>

<p>Darry was surprised to receive such a challenge
from the lank youth, but he did not hesitate to
accept, and away went both lads before either the
professor or the guide could stop them.</p>

<p>At first it was nip-and-tuck, for Hockley’s beast
was also swift of foot, and it was not long before
the racers passed out of sight beyond a turn. Professor
Strong began to look serious but the Cuban
guide only smiled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>“They will not run far,” he said, in Spanish.
“And when they drop into a walk they will pay up
for their speed by going slower than ever.”</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the others set off after the two in
advance, for the guide feared they would take to the
wrong road, one leading into the country and away
from the caves.</p>

<p>This was just what Darry and Hockley did, and
soon they came to what was little better than a
rough trail, with thatched huts on either side. The
mules kept together at first but presently Darry
forged ahead.</p>

<p>“Whoop I here we go!” he yelled. “Look out
for the mountain express!” And then he had to
cling fast, as the mule switched his heavy-ended
tail and kicked up with his rear hoofs.</p>

<p>Soon Darry reached what seemed to be the middle
of a settlement, with huts on all sides. Here was
a big stone cistern, filled with water, and with the
top wide open. Several natives were at hand, some
of them with buckets and shells.</p>

<p>As soon as he reached the cistern the mule Darry
rode came to an abrupt halt. Looking back the boy
saw that Hockley was now having his hands full<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
with his steed, which was rearing and plunging in
a most surprising fashion.</p>

<p>“Look out, Glummy, or he’ll throw you!” he
sang out. “He’s getting his dander up!”</p>

<p>“He shan’t throw me!” panted Hockley. “I’ll
show him who is master!” And he hit the mule on
the neck with his fist.</p>

<p>By this time the professor and the other boys
came riding up, along with the guide. Hockley’s
mule kept dancing around, and they had to move
from one spot to another to keep out of the way.</p>

<p>“Better get off!” began Professor Strong, when
of a sudden the mule made a sudden bolt forward.</p>

<p>Four leaps took the animal to the low wall of
the cistern and here he stopped abruptly. Then up
went his rear hoofs like lightning and in an instant
Hockley was thrown into the air. Down came the
youth head first, to strike the water with a loud
splash, and then he disappeared from sight.</p>

<p>A perfect roar of laughter went up, both from
the boys and from the natives, and Professor
Strong kept a straight face with difficulty. It was
a truly comical sight, and when Hockley came up
the boys had to laugh still more. In going down<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
the lank youth’s head had touched the unclean
bottom of the cistern and now his hair and face were
covered with a greenish mud and slime awful to behold.</p>

<p>“Hel—help me out, somebody!” he spluttered,
blowing the water from his mouth.</p>

<p>“I’ll help you,” answered the professor, and leaping
to the ground he gave the unfortunate one his
hand. Getting out of the cistern was easy and in
a moment more Hockley stood in the roadway
brushing the water and dirt from him and glaring
savagely at Darry and the others.</p>

<p>“It ain’t no laughing matter!” he howled. “You
shut up, or I’ll give you something to laugh
about.”</p>

<p>“It’s too bad, Glummy,” began Mark, when he
could suppress his feelings sufficiently to speak.
“But you did look so funny——”</p>

<p>“I don’t want you to talk to me!” stormed
Hockley, working himself up into a perfect rage.
“You are all against me. I’m going back to the
city, and maybe I’ll start for home to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“Be calm, Jacob,” put in the professor. “It was
truly unfortunate, but there is no occasion for making<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
matters worse by losing control of your temper.
I dare say if I had been thrown into the cistern all of
you would have laughed just as hard.”</p>

<p>“I don’t care, they are all down on me!”
grumbled Hockley.</p>

<p>“I believe you only imagine it. Come, we will
find some place where you can wash up and have
your clothing dried.”</p>

<p>“I’ll go back to the hotel and change my clothing.
I don’t want to see the caves.”</p>

<p>Hockley was obdurate, and in the end he was
allowed to depart, after having washed up in a
nearby hut. A native conducted him back to the
city, so that he might not lose his way. Once at
the hotel he lost no time in getting some liquor
and a package of cigarettes, and, in the privacy of
a room the party had engaged, lay down to read
another “thriller” he had purchased before leaving
Havana. But he was full of bitterness, and
his resolve to “fix” the others was greater than
ever.</p>

<p>The trip to the Caves of Bellamar proved of interest
to the boys, who brought with them upon their
return a number of specimens of beautifully colored<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
stones to be found there. While in the caves they
had great sport with the echoes, and the guide
pointed out to them a spot in which over a hundred
Cubans had been imprisoned and starved to death in
years gone by, during one of the awful uprisings
in that part of the island.</p>

<p>When the boys got back to Matanzas they were
glad enough to rest in the patio of the hotel before
attempting to re-arrange their toilets and dine.
Mark and Frank sank into one hammock and Darry
and Sam in another, while Professor Strong rested
in an easy chair not far away.</p>

<p>While they were resting, Hockley, whose room
was directly above the patio, heard them talking,
and their apparent happiness caused a sour look
to spread over his face.</p>

<p>“If only they had gone into that cistern instead
of me!” he muttered to himself, and then his eyes
rested on a bowl of dirty water he had left on the
washstand. “Just the thing!” he added. “I’ll see
how they like it.”</p>

<p>To catch up the bowl of dirty water was but the
work of an instant and he crossed to the window
under which the boys were sitting. But then he
paused.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>“If I throw it from here, they’ll know I did it,”
he reasoned. “I’ll go into the hallway.”</p>

<p>The hallway led around a corner, and here was
another window, also opening upon the courtyard.
The place was deserted and the window was wide
open. Looking to make sure that he was not observed,
Hockley threw the water out and then turned
and ran with all speed for his own room. He put
the bowl where it belonged, went outside again,
locked the door, and ran down the front stairs, leading
to the hotel reading room.</p>

<p>The bully’s aim was true, and the scattering water
covered all four of the boys pretty thoroughly, and
even the professor did not escape entirely.</p>

<p>“My gracious, what’s this!” spluttered Mark,
who caught some in his eyes. “Who threw that
water down on me?”</p>

<p>He leaped up and so did the others. They gazed
up at the hall window but could see nobody. Yet
they knew that it had come from there and in the
mind of each rushed the same thought:</p>

<p>“Hockley!”</p>

<p>“Of course he did it!” cried Darry, brushing off
his shoulders. “He wants to pay us for laughing
at him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>“I’ll pay him!” returned Sam, and made a dash
for the doorway of the hotel, before Professor
Strong could stop him. The others came behind,
the professor calling out that they must behave
themselves.</p>

<p>It puzzled them greatly to find the door to the
room locked. They pounded in vain and then had
to wait until Professor Strong opened the door to
the apartment adjoining. Then they passed
through a connecting door.</p>

<p>“Nobody here,” said Sam, staring around. “If
he did it he got out in mighty quick order.”</p>

<p>“Nobody in the hall,” came from Mark, who had
taken a look around. “But I don’t believe a servant
would have thrown that water into the garden.”</p>

<p>“The wash bowl is empty and the pitcher is less
than half full,” came from Frank. “The pitcher
was full when we left—the servant just came and
filled it.”</p>

<p>“Let’s look for Hockley,” was Darry’s advice,
but fearing a bitter quarrel and perhaps a fight, the
professor told them to leave the big youth alone and
prepare themselves for supper. As all were more
than ordinarily hungry, this changed the current
of their thoughts and they did as requested.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>When they entered the dining hall they found
Hockley waiting for them. He put on an injured
air.</p>

<p>“Thought you were never coming to dine,” he
grumbled. “Next time I guess I’ll eat alone.”</p>

<p>“You may, Jacob, if you feel too hungry to
wait,” answered the professor.</p>

<p>“Say, Hockley, did you—” began Mark, when
Frank pinched his arm.</p>

<p>“Don’t let on,” whispered Frank to his chum.
“If he doesn’t know anything about it don’t give
him the chance to laugh at us.”</p>

<p>“Did I what?” questioned the bully.</p>

<p>“Oh, it doesn’t matter,” answered Mark, unconcernedly.</p>

<p>And there, for the time being, the affair rested.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVI<br>

<small>GOOD-BYE TO CUBA</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">From</span> Matanzas the party journeyed to Cardenas,
where a day was spent in sight-seeing, and then
took the train for Santa Clara, stopping off for
two hours at the city of Colon. The route now lay
around some lofty mountains and the scenery was
grand in consequence. Two days were spent at
Santa Clara and then they moved on to Cienfuegos
on the south coast.</p>

<p>“Cienfuegos means the City of a Hundred
Fires,” said Professor Strong. “Why it is called
that I cannot tell excepting it may be on account
of volcanic actions of years ago. It is probably the
most up-to-date city in Cuba and will be still better
after the sanitary arrangements have been completed.”</p>

<p>“Wasn’t there some sort of a fight off Cienfuegos
during the late war?” questioned Sam.</p>

<p>“Yes. Some of our warships went in to cut the
cables lying on the harbor bottom and the Spanish<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
soldiers gave them battle. It was a hot contest, but
it did not last very long.”</p>

<p>The boys found Cienfuegos fully as up-to-date as
the professor had said it was. To be sure there were
many narrow streets and not a few old buildings,
but the general appearance was far superior to that
of many towns through which they had passed.
There were many fine public buildings and a nice
park, where a fountain played and where a band held
forth in the cool of the evening. The natives, too,
were well dressed, even the children wearing shoes
and stockings, articles usually lacking at places in
the interior.</p>

<p>“Don’t see youngsters half dressed here,” remarked
Frank. “It’s awful how they let ’em run
around at some villages. They ought to be
ashamed.”</p>

<p>“It’s what they have been brought up to, Frank,”
returned Mark. “They don’t look at it as anything
of a disgrace. Our own Indians didn’t use to wear
much, and now look at them. Why, Darry told me
he saw some at an agency in the far West wearing
patent leather boots and stove-pipe hats.”</p>

<p>“I guess Darry was drawing on his imagination,”
laughed Frank. “But I know they dress<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
well, some of them. I’ve seen them up at St. Regis,
in New York state.”</p>

<p>At Cienfuegos passage was obtained on the <i>City
of Madrid</i> for Santiago de Cuba. Before purchasing
his steamer tickets the professor made certain
that the accommodations would be first-class, so that
the party would experience no such trouble as had
fallen to their lot on board of the <i>Chester</i>.</p>

<p>“That’s right,” said Sam, in speaking of the
matter to Amos Strong. “One such experience is
enough. I wonder if we’ll ever set eyes on Captain
Sudlip again.”</p>

<p>“I hope not, Samuel. The less we fall in with
such people the better off we will be.”</p>

<p>“I believe you, sir. He and that Dan Markel
would make a team for meanness.”</p>

<p>“Wonder if we’ll ever see Markel again,” remarked
Frank.</p>

<p>“Don’t want to see him,” growled Hockley.</p>

<p>“We don’t, that’s a fact,” put in Mark, yet they
were to see the man from Baltimore, and under very
peculiar circumstances.</p>

<p>Now that they had spent over two weeks on land
the boys did not object to going on shipboard once
more. The run eastward along the coast of Cuba<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
to Santiago Bay would take a little over two days,
the distance being little less than four hundred miles,
around Cape Cruz.</p>

<p>“We will not run close to shore,” said the professor.
“If you will look at the map you will see
that there are many islands here, and also many
keys, as they are called—little islands. The channels
are dangerous, too, but especially in a storm.”</p>

<p>“I hope we don’t get any storm,” said Darry.</p>

<p>His wish was fulfilled and the trip to Santiago
passed off without anything out of the ordinary
happening. The <i>City of Madrid</i> proved an old but
very comfortable steamer, and the meals served were
more than satisfactory.</p>

<p>“There is where the <i>Merrimac</i> was sunk by Lieutenant
Hobson,” said the professor, as they passed
the spot, in the channel leading from the Caribbean
Sea to Santiago Bay. “Hobson and his brave men
were fired upon from half a dozen points about here
and in spite of all they could do were finally caught
and placed under arrest.”</p>

<p>“But they were afterwards released,” put in
Frank. “It was a daring thing to do, that’s sure.”</p>

<p>They found Santiago very much like other Cuban
cities they had visited. But the recent rule by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
United States authority was very much in evidence
and even the side streets, unusually narrow, were
clean and orderly. Santiago lies near the head of
the bay, on the eastern shore, and in the distance
they could see the hills of El Caney and San Juan,
made famous in the Spanish-American war by
Roosevelt’s Rough Riders and others of Uncle Sam’s
soldier boys. Coming up the coast from Cape Cruz
they had already had pointed out to them the spots
where the Spanish warships had either been sunk
or run ashore by our warships under Commodores
Sampson and Schley.</p>

<p>“It must have been a great victory,” said Darry,
when they were touring the city. “How scared the
people must have been when they were told that our
troops were pressing in on them.”</p>

<p>“The fortifications were several miles outside of
the city limits,” returned the professor. “But gradually,
after the fall of the blockhouses at El Caney
and San Juan, our troops hemmed the Spaniards in
closer and closer, and then there was, of course, much
anxiety. You see, the Spanish soldiers were in a
bad situation, for even the citizens of the town were
largely against them and hoped for a Yankee
victory.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>Among the places of interest visited were the
prisons in which our captured soldiers and sailors
had been kept. Some of the underground dungeons
made them shudder.</p>

<p>“Cubans were kept here as well as our people,”
said Professor Strong. “Some of the Cuban rebels,
as they were called, were held in solitary confinement
for years. It was horrible, and it is a grand
good thing that Spain’s hold on this island has at
last been broken.”</p>

<p>In Santiago they saw something which they had
already noted in other towns but which nevertheless
made then laugh again and again. This was
a milkman driving his cows through the street and
crying: “Milk for sale! Good milk for sale!” in
Spanish. When somebody wanted milk the vendor
would stop one of his cows, take the bowl or shell
brought to him, and milk out as much of the lacteal
fluid as was desired.</p>

<p>“Anyway, they get it fresh,” was Frank’s comment,
when talking of the matter. “They can’t
adulterate it either.”</p>

<p>The boys had thought to spend several days in
Santiago, which is the capital city of the Eastern
Department of Cuba, but Professor Strong learned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
that a particularly good steamer would sail for Cape
Haytien in Hayti and San Juan, Porto Rico, on the
day following, and he resolved to take this, so a
talked-of ride into the interior had to be given up.</p>

<p>“Never mind,” said Amos Strong. “When we
get to Porto Rico we will take the long ride over the
old military road from San Juan to Ponce. That
will give you a good idea of rural life in the West
Indies. If we miss this steamer there is no telling
when we will get one quite so good.”</p>

<p>“Oh, let’s go on by all means,” put in Hockley.
“Santiago is too dead slow for me. It’s a good
deal like all the rest of Cuba.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Jake, you want to wake up!” cried Sam,
impulsively. “I haven’t heard you say a good word
for any of the places. To me they are all full of
interest. We are learning a great deal by traveling
around.”</p>

<p>“Now don’t preach!” interrupted the lank youth.
“I know what I am doing.” And then he continued,
as the professor turned away: “It would be
all right if we had a lively crowd along and if a
fellow could do as he pleased when it came to sport.
But as it is——” And he ended with a shrug of his
shoulders.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>That very night, as Hockley was walking along
the street, he passed a ship’s chandlery and in the
window saw a sign, “Pitch for Sale.” Struck by
a sudden idea after he had gone by, he retraced his
steps and entered the shop, and asked the price of
the pitch. It was cheap enough and he soon had
about a pint in his possession, done up securely in a
tin can and wrapped in a heavy paper. He secreted
the bundle under his coat.</p>

<p>The idea that had entered his mind was not wholly
original with him. In one of the cheap novels he
had read, “Pete Prankley, the Sassiest Boy in Sawtown,”
Pete, the hero had had no end of fun by
putting pitch into his father’s shoes at home and on
the minister’s seat at church. It was a roaring good
joke, according to Hockley’s notion, and to play
something like that on the other boys would be just
the thing.</p>

<p>But how could he do it without being detected?
It might prove easy enough to get the pitch into the
shoes without being seen, but if all the crowd suffered
but himself they would surely lay the blame
on him, and he had no idea of making himself suffer
with them.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ve got it!” he exclaimed at last, when he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
had cudgeled his brain for over an hour. “Just the
thing! I’ll have my revenge on all of them, and one
of them will catch it for keeps, too! It’s the best
plan yet!”</p>

<p>And he almost fell to hugging himself with
delight.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVII<br>

<small>A JOKE ON SHIPBOARD</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> steamer <i>Clarissa</i>, on which the boys now
found themselves, was of the old-fashioned type,
broad of beam and of rather light draught. But
she was a very comfortable craft and after spending
a day on board they were glad that Professor Strong
had secured passage on her.</p>

<p>There were among the passengers half a dozen
Americans, bound for San Juan, so the trip was
more lively than those before taken. In the crowd
were several good piano players, and as the saloon
of the <i>Clarissa</i> boasted of a fairly good piano there
was a good deal of music, especially during the
evening. All the boys could sing, and none of
them were “backward about coming forward,” as
Darry expressed it. Even Hockley sang, for he had
a fair voice and loved to show it off at the least
opportunity.</p>

<p>“One of the passengers tells me that Hayti is a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
great place for revolutions,” said Mark to the professor,
on the morning of the second day out.</p>

<p>“Hayti has been a hot-bed of revolutions for
years,” answered Amos Strong, “and even to-day
matters are far from settled there. At one time the
island, which contains about twenty-eight thousand
miles of territory and a population of 1,300,000
souls, was under a single government, but to-day it
is divided into Hayti and Santo Domingo. The
great majority of the inhabitants are black, and the
whites have, in consequence, had a hard time of it.
The French buccaneers used to make Hayti a stopping
place and they had many a fierce fight with
the blacks, and there was a continual struggle between
the blacks that were slaves and their masters.”</p>

<p>“I don’t imagine it is a nice place to visit,” put
in Frank, who was listening to the talk.</p>

<p>“There are many better places, I admit. Yet, as
it is right on our way we can very well stop off a
day at Cape Haytien and take a look around.”</p>

<p>“Somebody said they had earthquakes there,” put
in Sam.</p>

<p>“All these islands are of volcanic origin and
earthquakes are frequent. Hayti has a mountain
range from one end almost to the other, and one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
peak, Cibao, is seven thousand feet high. The
mountains are covered with valuable timber and
the island exports large quantities of mahogany and
other woods. The mountains are, like those north
of Santiago de Cuba, full of rich minerals, but so
far only a few mines have been opened.”</p>

<p>Directly after this conversation the professor
brought out his largest map of the islands and the
boys looked it over with care. They found that
Hayti lay about equally distant from Cuba and Porto
Rico. On the west was the Windward Passage,
separating it from Cuba, and on the east the Mona
Passage, separating it from Porto Rico.</p>

<p>“The Mona Passage,” mused Sam, “That’s the
Monkey Passage, that we passed through on our
way from New York to Venezuela.”</p>

<p>“I see Port-au-Prince is the capital city,” remarked
Frank. “But that is about a hundred miles
south of our stopping place.”</p>

<p>The evening proved a most delightful one and
nobody thought of going to bed until a late hour.
As a consequence hardly any of the boys felt like
arising early, and it was not until the breakfast gong
had sounded the second time that Mark and Frank
leaped up.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>“I didn’t know it was so late!” exclaimed Frank,
as he glanced at his watch, and then he fairly flew
into his clothing, and so did Mark.</p>

<p>They had just slipped on their shoes when there
came a knock on the stateroom door and they admitted
Sam.</p>

<p>“See here, who put this stuff in my shoes—”
began Sam, when he noticed Mark kicking his foot
on a locker. Then Frank did the same. A moment
later they were sitting down trying to pull off their
shoes, which refused to budge.</p>

<p>“By cracky! I can’t do a thing with mine!”
puffed Mark. “Whatever has gotten into them?”</p>

<p>“It’s pitch, that’s what it is,” growled Sam.
“Here is some on the tongue of my shoe. I can’t
budge my feet.”</p>

<p>“And the stuff smarts like mischief,” came from
Frank. “Say, do you know what I think?” he went
on.</p>

<p>“It’s a joke of Hockley’s,” came from both of the
others.</p>

<p>“Exactly.”</p>

<p>“If it is, we’ll pay him back with interest,” said
Mark, grimly.</p>

<p>The pitch was of the extra sticky kind and clung<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
to them like fish glue. They stamped and kicked,
pulled and hauled, but all to no purpose.</p>

<p>The uproar was so great that Professor Strong
came to the stateroom to see what was the matter.
In the meantime Hockley heard the rumpus and
smiled broadly.</p>

<p>“It worked!” he murmured. “Now wait until
the finish!”</p>

<p>The finish was not long in coming. There was a
tramping of feet before the door and a knock from
Professor Strong.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, coming!” called out Hockley, sleepily.</p>

<p>“Hockley, did you put pitch into the other boys’
shoes?” demanded Amos Strong, sternly.</p>

<p>“Me? Pitch?” asked the lank youth, in pretended
astonishment. “I don’t know what you are
talking about.”</p>

<p>“The other boys’ shoes are filled with pitch.”</p>

<p>Hockley walked across the floor and picked up his
own shoes.</p>

<p>“So are mine, sir. Somebody has played a trick
on me!” He flung the door open. “See here, I
ain’t going to stand this!” he roared, in assumed
anger. “It’s a jolly shame! This pair of shoes cost
me ten dollars!” And he shook his head savagely.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>“We’re all in the same boat,” said Mark, helplessly.
The fact that Hockley had been treated like
the others puzzled him a good deal.</p>

<p>Professor Strong looked into Hockley’s shoes.
True enough each contained pitch, although not
very much and what there was did not stick very
fast.</p>

<p>“This is certainly mysterious—” began the
professor, and at that moment Darry came up,
he having gone to the dining room to look for
them.</p>

<p>“Why don’t you come to breakfast,” he said.
“I’m as hungry as a bear.”</p>

<p>“Have you pitch in your shoes?” came from the
other boys.</p>

<p>“Pitch? What do you mean?” queried Darry,
innocently.</p>

<p>“We’ve all got pitch in our shoes, and it hurts
like creation!” spluttered Frank, and began to work
at the foot coverings once more, while Mark and
Sam did the same.</p>

<p>“Pitch,” repeated Darry, and then as the humor
of the situation dawned on him he laughed loudly.
“Well, this is rich! All stuck, eh, like flies on flypaper.
Ha! ha! ha! You won’t get your shoes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
off for a week!” And he burst into another fit of
laughter.</p>

<p>“I’ll bet he did it,” cried Hockley. “If I can
prove it I’ll make you buy me a new pair of shoes!”
And he shook the shoes in Darry’s face.</p>

<p>Darry was in particularly good humor that morning,
and he could hardly control himself. He gazed
at one and another, tugging at the refractory foot
coverings, and fairly shook with laughter. In the
midst of this Professor Strong caught him by the
arm.</p>

<p>“Is this some of your work, Dartworth?” he
questioned.</p>

<p>“My work? Why—er—no, sir.”</p>

<p>“It is—he needn’t deny it,” put in Hockley. “I
saw him with some pitch yesterday.”</p>

<p>This was true, for Darry had picked up a small
ball of the stuff which Hockley had placed where
he knew the other lad would be certain to see it.
And now the professor remembered seeing the pitch,
too.</p>

<p>“This is not the kind of a joke I like,” said Amos
Strong, severely. “I thought better of you, Crane.
These boys will have hard work to get themselves
free of the mess.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>“I’ve got one foot out!” cried Mark, and out it
came, but minus the sock, which was left where it
had stuck.</p>

<p>The others were working with a will and at last
they got free of both shoes and socks, and then Professor
Strong sent them back to their staterooms to
don other foot coverings. Having looked into his
own stateroom he found his shoes also full of the
pitch, which he had escaped by putting on a pair of
traveling slippers.</p>

<p>“I will not have such jokes played,” he said,
when he encountered Darry once more. “You
should be above it. If such a thing happens again
I shall have to punish you.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t—” began Darry, and then shut his
mouth hard. Even though ordinarily light-hearted,
Darry had a temper, and now it began to rise at
this unjust accusation. The professor looked at
him and he looked at the professor, and then they
separated.</p>

<p>But little was said at the breakfast table, but once
a glance passed between Darry and Hockley which
was far from friendly. The meal was soon over,
and then Mark, Frank and Sam followed Darry to
his stateroom.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>“Look here, Darry, we want to know the truth of
this,” began Mark, when the door was shut. “Did
you do this, or didn’t you?”</p>

<p>Darry began to whistle and looked at the ceiling.</p>

<p>“If you think I did it why do you ask me?” he
snapped at last.</p>

<p>“Well—er—Hockley says you had the pitch.”</p>

<p>“I’ll take Darry’s word every time,” put in Sam,
who saw that a crisis was at hand.</p>

<p>“So will I,” added Frank.</p>

<p>“I’m not holding back,” put in Mark, hastily.
“Even if he did do it, it was only a joke. But if
he didn’t do it, we ought to know it and lay for
the joker. I won’t stand for such a joke from anybody
outside of our crowd.”</p>

<p>“Would you take such a joke from me?” demanded
Darry, suddenly, and now he looked one
and another full in the face.</p>

<p>“Yes,” came in a chorus.</p>

<p>Darry looked relieved.</p>

<p>“Well then, I didn’t do it, and I don’t know who
did.”</p>

<p>It was Frank who caught his hand first, but Sam
and Mark were not much slower.</p>

<p>“We knew it!” they cried.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>“Nobody in this crowd would play a joke on the
rest!” added Sam.</p>

<p>“But who did do it?” queried Frank. “It wasn’t
Hockley, for he was dosed, too.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you be so sure about Hockley,” put in
Darry. “I was thinking it over at the table. He
had pitch in his shoes, but he didn’t put those shoes
on, and I’ll wager he gets the pitch out easily.”</p>

<p>“Then you think it was he after all?” queried
Mark.</p>

<p>“I don’t know what to think. But he’ll bear
watching, according to my notion.”</p>

<p>“Let’s search his room,” suggested Frank. “We
may find some evidence against him.”</p>

<p>This was considered a good idea and Frank went
out, to come back a minute later and report the
coast clear. Then they hurried to Hockley’s stateroom,
and began a quick search around.</p>

<p>“Whoop, I’ve got it!” ejaculated Mark, drawing
a can from a corner under the berth. “Pitch,
as sure as you are born!”</p>

<p>“Come out of that!” sang out Darry, who was
gazing down the stateroom corridor. “Hockley is
coming.”</p>

<p>“Put the can back and don’t let on we know<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>
about it,” said Sam. And this was done, and they
escaped from the stateroom just in the nick of time.
Then they returned to their own quarters and all
four of the boys set to work to clean out the bepitched
shoes.</p>

<p>“We must get square for this,” said Frank. “To
let it pass unnoticed would be criminal.”</p>

<p>“Right you are,” responded Darry. “And as
he did his best to place the blame on me I claim
the honor for hatching out the plot to even up.”</p>

<p>“But we are going to help,” put in Sam; and so
it was agreed.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVIII<br>

<small>HAYTI, SUGAR MAKING, AND ANOTHER JOKE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> weather remained all that could be desired,
and the run to Cape Haytien was made without special
incident. Darry did his best to hatch out something
against Hockley but no opportunity occurred
for “squaring up” as the boys called it. Perhaps
Professor Strong suspected that something was
afloat, for he kept a close watch on all his charges.</p>

<p>He no longer suspected Darry of being the author
of the pitch joke, for Mark and Frank had told him
that Darry had said he was innocent, and he had
always found the fun-loving lad truthful. The boys
had said nothing of finding the can in Hockley’s
stateroom,—that was their own secret.</p>

<p>The harbor of Cape Haytien is rather a difficult
one to enter, on account of the many reefs and
shoals in that vicinity, but the bay upon which the
town is located is a fine one, being encircled by many
hills, covered with forests of various hues.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>“This isn’t so bad,” observed Mark, on landing.
“It’s a good deal cleaner than I thought.”</p>

<p>“Cape Haytien has quite a commerce with the
United States,” said Professor Strong. “Sugar
and molasses are staples here. If you wish we can
visit a sugar works and see how the toothsome article
and molasses are made.”</p>

<p>“I don’t like molasses,” said Hockley. “It’s too
common. I always take honey on my buckwheat
cakes,” and then everybody laughed.</p>

<p>“There are a good many ruins here,” went on
Professor Strong. “They are due to the bombardment
which the town sustained at the hands of the
British, in 1865, and to other outbreaks, and earthquakes.
The inhabitants number about twenty-five
thousand. There is a cathedral here, and also several
public buildings, which are worth visiting.”</p>

<p>Having but a single day ashore, they hired a carriage
and took a long drive around, passing several
large and well-kept squares, and also the soldiers’
barracks, the post-office, and other points of interest.
Then they drove out to a plantation noted for its
fine grade of sugar and molasses.</p>

<p>“As all of you know,” said Professor Strong,
while waiting for an attendant to take them around,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>
“Sugar in the West Indies is made almost wholly
from the sugar cane, which is cut down when it is
ripe and hauled to the mills. The mills are of all
sorts, from the most primitive of old Spanish days
to the up-to-date American mill which costs many
thousands of dollars to erect.</p>

<p>“The process of manufacturing sugar and refining
it is a complicated one as carried on to-day,
yet the principle of making sugar is very simple.
The cane is fed between large iron or steel rollers,
weighing ten or twelve tons. The rollers run very
slowly and every bit of the juice of the cane is
squeezed out of it. This juice is then brought
gradually to a boil and all the foreign matter is
either skimmed off or the clear fluid is drawn away
from underneath. Then what is left is boiled again
until the sugar begins to separate from the molasses.
The last boiling is a very delicate process and only
workers of long experience can make really good
sugar. From being a thin kind of syrup the sugar
gradually becomes like porridge and thicker, and it
is then run off into forms, containing one or two
hundred pounds. From these forms runs the syrup
not yet crystalized, and this is either boiled up once
more or rejected and barreled as molasses.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>“Then molasses is really sugar that won’t get
hard,” said Frank.</p>

<p>“That is about it, Frank, although there are different
kinds of molasses. Cheap molasses has less
of the sugary element left in it than that of a high
grade. The very best of molasses is not called
molasses at all but treacle. This is made, not during
ordinary sugar making, but while the sugar is
being refined or manufactured into fancy forms.
Treacle is much used in England.”</p>

<p>They were soon shown through the sugar mill,
and watched with interest the huge rollers squeezing
out the juice of the cane, which looked dark and
dirty. At one place they saw bullock’s blood
poured in to help cleanse it of impurities, and
they saw long rows of pots with the sugar
being passed from one to another in the clarifying
process, and also saw a huge vacuum pan,
where the sugar could be brought to a boil at a
low degree of heat.</p>

<p>“Too much heat spoil de sugar,” explained the
attendant. “Sugar best like dis,” and he put his
hand into the syrup and withdrew it and then spread
out two fingers, showing the gummy liquid expanded
like thin rubber. Then he led them to where<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>
sugar was being made into fancy squares and other
forms.</p>

<p>“A good part of the sugar is sent to our country
in its raw state,” said the professor, as they were
coming away from the mill. “It is refined at large
refineries, where the proprietors make a specialty of
catering to our own peculiar tastes. Some time
ago I saw a statement printed that Americans use
more sugar per capita than any other nation, and I
believe it is true.”</p>

<p>“Sure,” said Darry. “And you know why?
Because the girls eat so many caramels and so much
fudge.”</p>

<p>“And because some boys like their coffee and tea
doubly sweet,” returned the professor, dryly, and
then a laugh went up, for all knew this was one of
Darry’s weaknesses.</p>

<p>They had put in what Mark called “a big day,”
and all were glad enough to go back to the steamer
by nightfall. In the evening Cape Haytien is a dull
place, poorly lighted, and with only a few amusements,
and those usually of the commoner sort. But
before coming away they listened to a number of
natives who played guitars and sang, and the music
was exceedingly sweet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>The following day found the <i>Clarissa</i> leaving the
harbor and turning eastward for Porto Rico. So
far the weather had been fine, but now the sky began
to cloud over, showing that a tropical storm was
approaching.</p>

<p>“I hope we don’t catch much of it,” said Frank to
Darry. “I’ve had enough of that sort of thing.”</p>

<p>“I should like to see a little storm, and that at
night,” answered Darry.</p>

<p>“A little storm at night? What for?”</p>

<p>“So I can pay Hockley for the trick he played
us.”</p>

<p>“But I don’t understand, Darry.”</p>

<p>“You will understand, if the storm comes,” answered
the light-hearted lad, but would say no more.</p>

<p>A little later Frank met Sam and Mark and told
them of what Darry had said.</p>

<p>“He’s got something up his sleeve,” said Mark.
“Well, we promised to let him have his inning first,
so let him do as he pleases.”</p>

<p>By nightfall the storm was close at hand and the
rain kept them in the cabin. There was considerable
wind, but the officers of the ship assured the
passengers that there was no danger.</p>

<p>Hockley read for an hour and then declared his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>
intention of going to bed. He had hardly disappeared
when Darry followed, but first told his chums
to watch for fun.</p>

<p>It was raining hard when Hockley turned in.
Truth to tell the rolling and pitching of the ship
had made him somewhat sick and he had retired
partly to avoid the others, for he knew they might
laugh at him. But he was a good sleeper and soon
he was slumbering soundly.</p>

<p>In the meantime Darry was not idle. From a
stateroom he obtained a large basin of water. Then
he hunted up a couple of cheap glass tumblers and
placed them in the foot of an old sock. Thus armed
he crept to Hockley’s door. It was unfastened, and
the snoring of the lank youth told him that the time
was ripe for what he intended to do.</p>

<p>Bang! the door flew open with a crash, arousing
Hockley on the instant. As he sat up in the berth
a dash of water landed on his head and ran down his
spinal column. Then came a crash of glass that
made him jump.</p>

<p>“All hands on deck!” he heard a hoarse voice
cry. “The ship is sinking!” And then came another
crash of glass and more water hit him in the
face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>Confused, and almost scared out of his wits, the
bully gave one bound that took him half way across
the stateroom floor. He caught up his trousers and
slipped them on. “We are going down!” he
groaned. “Oh, why did I ever leave land!” And
then, as the steamer gave a lurch, he caught up the
rest of his clothing and made for the corridor, down
which he bolted like lightning and up the stairs leading
to the main deck. Reaching this he glared
around, blinking in the light.</p>

<p>“What—who—what shall we do?” he demanded
of the first passenger he met, a rather fussy old
gentleman who did not like boys.</p>

<p>“Do?” demanded the old gentleman. He adjusted
his eyeglasses and stared at Hockley. “Why,
young man, what is the matter with you? Have
you gone crazy?”</p>

<p>“Ain’t the ship sinking?” gasped Hockley.</p>

<p>“Not that I am aware of.”</p>

<p>“But—er—” The youth gazed around him in
amazement. Nobody appeared to be excited, and
some folks were even at the piano, playing and singing.
Then he caught sight of Darry and the other
boys, who were behind a nearby column and laughing
heartily.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>“Hi! what are you laughing at?” he roared,
rushing toward the crowd. “I want to know——”</p>

<p>“Glummy must have been dreaming the ship was
going to sink,” came from Mark.</p>

<p>“And he wasn’t going to leave his shoes behind
either,” put in Frank, pointing to the pair the bully
carried in his hand.</p>

<p>“Nor his collar and tie,” added Sam. “Nothing
like being dressed up, even if you’re swimming for
your life.”</p>

<p>“I won’t stand this—I’ll fix all of you, see if I
don’t!” howled Hockley, shaking his fists at them
and dropping half of his wearing apparel in his excitement.
“I’ll—I’ll——” And then he suddenly
thought of the figure he cut, and the crowd that
was beginning to gather, and ran for his stateroom
with as much speed as he had used in leaving
it.</p>

<p>He was in too much of a rage to retire again, and
as soon as he had dressed he came out to hunt up
the boys. They were waiting for him, fearful that
he would inform Professor Strong of the affair.
Fortunately the professor had been in the smoking
room at the time and he as yet knew nothing of what
had occurred.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>“See here,” began Hockley. “I want to know
who played that trick on me.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think you’ll find out,” answered Mark.</p>

<p>“I’m going to tell the professor. My berth is
soaked with water and I came pretty close to cutting
my foot on a piece of glass on the floor.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t step into any pitch, did you?” asked
Sam, dryly.</p>

<p>“I say I am going to tell the professor,” went on
Hockley, working himself up into a magnificent
rage.</p>

<p>“I don’t think you will tell him,” answered Darry,
steadily. “You thought it a fine thing to put off
that pitch joke on my shoulders, didn’t you? Now
I guess I’ve paid you back, so we are quits.”</p>

<p>“So you did it?” howled Hockley. “I’m going
to Professor Strong this minute and show him the
berth——”</p>

<p>“If you do I’ll show him something else.”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“The can you had full of pitch. We found it,
and all can testify it was under your berth. Maybe
the professor won’t be angry at your duplicity in
that affair, Glummy. The best thing you can do is
to drop the matter and call it square.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>At these words Hockley’s face grew dark and full
of resentment.</p>

<p>“I’ll never drop it, never!” he exclaimed, vehemently.
“You are all against me! But I shan’t
stand it. Just wait until we are on shore and I’ll
show you what I can do!”</p>

<p>And with this he turned off on his heel and left
them.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIX<br>

<small>A TALK ABOUT PORTO RICO</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">He’s</span> down on us now, if he never was before,”
was Sam’s comment, after Hockley had disappeared.</p>

<p>“But he won’t go to Professor Strong with his
tale of woe,” put in Mark. “When Darry spoke
of the can of pitch he was scared and showed it.”</p>

<p>“He knew it was mean to put off that joke on
me,” said Darry. And then he added: “I don’t
think my joke was such a brilliant affair, but I reckon
it squared accounts.”</p>

<p>He had to go into the details of what he had done,
and the boys had another laugh, for boys are but
boys, and it had been fun to see the bully dancing
around in such alarm.</p>

<p>By morning the storm was over and the sun came
out so fiercely that all were glad enough to remain
in the shade of the awning spread over the forward
deck, where a little breeze was blowing.</p>

<p>“We are now in the track of Columbus on his
first voyage to the New World,” said Professor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>
Strong. “He sailed across this very spot a little
over four hundred and eight years ago.”</p>

<p>“What tremendous changes since then,” said
Sam. “He found our own States inhabited by Indians
and now a good many of our inhabitants have
never seen an Indian, outside of a Wild West show
or a circus.”</p>

<p>“Yes, the march of progress has been great, Samuel,
and I do not doubt but what it will be still
greater in the future. We are coming to a point
where everything seems possible, even to wireless
telephones and practical airships.”</p>

<p>During the afternoon the professor called the boys
together in a quiet corner of the cabin and hung up
a large map of Porto Rico.</p>

<p>“I want all of you to know something about this
new territory of the United States before we visit
it,” he said, when they had settled themselves. “To
us it is, just at present, the most important of the
West Indies.”</p>

<p>“It doesn’t look very large,” said Hockley, gazing
rather blankly at the map.</p>

<p>“The island is about a hundred miles long, east
and west, and about thirty-five miles wide, north<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>
and south. It is almost rectangular in shape, as you
can see, and contains about 3,600 square miles of
territory.”</p>

<p>“It looks to be mountainous,” came from Mark.</p>

<p>“There is a range of mountains running from one
end of the island to the other. The average height
is fifteen hundred feet but one peak is three-quarters
of a mile high. Between the mountains are many
well-watered valleys and here the soil is remarkably
productive.”</p>

<p>“I’ve heard of Porto Rico tobacco,” came from
Darry.</p>

<p>“Yes, large quantities of very fine tobacco are
raised there, and also sugar, coffee, cattle and hides.
In years gone by they also raised a superior kind of
cotton, but that industry does not appear to be flourishing
just now.”</p>

<p>“I’ve heard that they used to have lots of slaves
here,” came from Frank.</p>

<p>“Yes, Porto Rico did have its full share of slaves,
and the Spanish plantation owners were very cruel
to them. Slavery flourished until 1873, when the
last of the poor blacks, numbering probably twenty
thousand souls, were freed. All told, there are now<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>
about a million people on the island, and the majority
of them are blacks or of mixed Spanish and black
blood.”</p>

<p>“I thought there were a great many folks here
from the United States,” said Mark.</p>

<p>“People are coming in by every steamer, and it
will not be long before Porto Rico will have all the
Yankees it can profitably use. Then first-class railroads
will be built and the mines developed, and
some day the island will find itself rich.”</p>

<p>“Aren’t there any railroads now?” asked
Hockley.</p>

<p>“Yes, but they do not amount to a great deal.
Along the north shore there is a line from San Juan
to Hatillo, on the west coast one from Aguadilla to
Mayaguez, and on the south shore one from Yauco
to Ponce, and that is all, so far as I know. There is
none in the east, where one is badly needed, and
none from the north side of the island to the south
side. The only means of communication between
San Juan, the principal city on the north, to Ponce,
the capital on the south, is by means of the great
military highway, which I mentioned to you before,
and which was built years ago. This highway runs
in an irregular course around the mountains and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>
over the hills, and connects half a dozen important
inland cities with the seacoast. What those cities
are we shall see when we ride over the road from
San Juan to Ponce, a distance of seventy-five miles
or more.</p>

<p>“Unlike Cuba and Jamaica, Porto Rico has a
great number of rivers and many of these are deep,
so that ships of fair size can sail upon them. The
water is very pure and some of it is shipped to
other islands for drinking purposes.</p>

<p>“The raising of cattle and sheep forms an important
industry and is carried on with ease, for
there are no wild animals to molest the stock and
very little disease.”</p>

<p>“No wild animals?” repeated Frank, and his
face fell. “That means no hunting.”</p>

<p>“You are right, Frank. About the only wild animals
I ever saw on the island were pigs and dogs.
Under the old Spanish rule,” continued the professor,
“matters were carried with a high hand by the
government. The people were taxed outrageously
and received little or nothing in return. Everything
was taxed, even to a dancing party, and to
prevent a revolution there was a law forbidding
more than nineteen people to assemble at a given<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>
place without a special license or else the representative
of the government had to be present. What few
schools the people had were only such in name, and
all citizens who could afford it sent their sons and
daughters off to be educated. Newspapers were of
the poorest and I never heard of but one magazine,
which was worse than those sold for five cents
at home. Those who owned slaves treated them
horribly, and the slaves would often retaliate by
misusing the horses, mules and cattle, and to-day
horses are misused there shamefully.”</p>

<p>“I saw a picture of an ox cart,” said Mark.
“Do they use them in Porto Rico?”</p>

<p>“Yes, they use all sorts of carts drawn by oxen,
and the poor beasts are driven along by having
goads prodded into them, so that the blood streams
from them. But under our rule all these cruelties
will some day cease.</p>

<p>“Strictly speaking, there is very little poverty in
the island, for a person can live on very little. The
climate is such that but scant clothing is required,
and fruit and vegetables are exceedingly cheap.
Any kind of a hut does for a shelter, and nothing
has to be spent for fuel or light. If a native owns
a little garden patch, and a few chickens and a cow,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>
he can get along without any trouble, even though
the whole outfit may not be worth a hundred
dollars.”</p>

<p>“It must be lazy man’s land,” laughed Darry.</p>

<p>“To a certain extent it is, and many of the Porto
Ricans have the old Spanish habit of putting off till
to-morrow what should be done to-day. They lie
around and smoke cigarettes, and arrange for cock
fights, which are here, as in other islands, the national
amusement. Years ago they used to have bull
fights, but that is a thing of the past.”</p>

<p>The talk now became general, and the boys and
the professor spent a good hour over the map, noting
the position of the various towns and rivers, bays
and mountains. The professor told a story about
getting lost on a strange road, and of how he had
seen a ghost which proved to be nothing but swamp-damp.</p>

<p>“When I finally got back to the road and told a
native of this, he said the swamp-damp came from
the bodies of brave soldiers who had died in battle,”
concluded Amos Strong.</p>

<p>The entrance to San Juan harbor is a difficult
one and steamers must be piloted in with great care.
But once inside there is a fine anchorage, two miles<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>
wide by three miles long, situated on the south side
of the city. Along this shore are located the governor’s
castle, the soldiers’ barracks, the custom house,
and a large number of warehouses and other buildings.
On the north side of the city is a finely-kept
cemetery and also another soldiers’ barracks.</p>

<p>“This city is really on an island,” said the professor,
when they found themselves landed, the day
after the talk above mentioned. “It is a long, narrow
peninsula, separated from the mainland by a
shallow body of water spanned by the San Antonio
bridge. As you can see, it is inclosed by a high
wall, which gives it the appearance of being what it
really is, an old Spanish town. The castle you see
on the bluff is Morro Castle, which played an important
part during the War with Spain, just as did
Morro Castle at Havana.”</p>

<p>The streets were alive with people, and the boys
were surprised to see how many were Americans.
English signs were everywhere in evidence, and one
reading, “Shooting Gallery, 3 Shots for 5 Cents,”
made Darry laugh.</p>

<p>“We are in an American town now for sure,” he
observed. “You’d never see such a sign elsewhere.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>“To be sure we are on United States soil,” cried
Frank. “Hurrah for Porto Rico and its people!”</p>

<p>He had scarcely spoken when a hack driver rushed
up to them.</p>

<p>“This way, gents!” he bawled. “Any hotel in
the city. Take the six of you for a dollar! Best keb
in the city!”</p>

<p>“Well!” ejaculated Mark, stopping short. “That
sounds as if we had struck the Grand Central Depot
in New York.”</p>

<p>“Oh, they are going to be up-to-date,” laughed
the professor. “No, we may as well walk to the
hotel and see the sights on the way,” he added, and
shook his head at the cabman, and also at the crowd
of native drivers who swarmed around them.</p>

<p>“I see they have gas and telephones,” said Sam.</p>

<p>“Yes, and also electric lights, Samuel—in fact
they now have everything which you will find in any
well-kept town in the States.”</p>

<p>“But the streets are narrow,” put in Frank.</p>

<p>“Only in the old part.”</p>

<p>The houses were of stone and brick, painted various
colors. The majority were of the old Spanish
style of architecture, with small windows and flat
roofs. Here and there was a new building, looking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>
strangely out of place, with its wide windows and
broad balconies.</p>

<p>Professor Strong had a friend in the hotel business
in San Juan, and to his place, called the Randall
House, they made their way. It proved to be a comfortable
hostelry, and they were assigned three spacious
rooms on the second floor. From the roof of
the hotel a splendid view of the entire city could be
obtained, and here the boys spent some time, while
the professor and the hotel proprietor pointed out
various points of interest to them.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XX<br>

<small>AN ADVENTURE IN THE MOUNTAINS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Three</span> days passed swiftly by. There was much
to be seen in San Juan, and the boys were out most
of the time, only resting during the middle of the
day, when the heat was too much for them.</p>

<p>During these days they visited various public
buildings and also the main college and two of the
principal churches. They learned that the city had
seven parks, and in one, the Plazuela de Santiago,
they saw a life-like statue of Columbus. They also
visited the governor’s palace, built by Ponce de
Leon, and the Santa Catalina fortifications. But
what interested them more than anything was the
small, huddled up native shops, with their quaint
keepers and their grand mixture of merchandise,
and the still more strange markets, with many vegetables
and fruits new to them. To these shops
came the native ladies, but they never dismounted
from their carriages but made the shop-keepers bring
out everything to them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>“They try to live as lazy and easy a life as they
can,” was Mark’s comment. “How American
energy must open their eyes.”</p>

<p>“The professor told me that San Juan used to be
an awfully dirty town,” said Sam. “But as soon as
our soldiers took hold they made the citizens clean
up, and the place has been kept clean ever since.
That helps to lessen disease and is certainly a blessing.”</p>

<p>During the stay in San Juan all the boys received
letters from home, and one which Hockley got contained
a money order which pleased him greatly.
He had written that he must have money, that Professor
Strong would allow him next to nothing, and
his over-indulgent father had relented and sent him
two hundred dollars.</p>

<p>“Now I’ll have some good times,” the bully told
himself. “And the rest of the fellows can go to
grass.”</p>

<p>The letters received by Mark and Frank contained
news of unusual interest to them. It was to the
effect that Mr. Newton and Mr. Robertson had
started for the West Indies on a trip combining
business with pleasure. They intended to stop off
at Kingston, Jamaica, and were then going to St.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>
Pierre, Martinique, and to Kingstown, on the island
of St. Vincent. The business was one connected
with the importation of certain dyes and coloring
matters which the dry goods importer was anxious
to obtain.</p>

<p>“I wish we could meet them down here!” cried
Frank, enthusiastically, when telling the others the
news.</p>

<p>“Perhaps we’ll meet them at St. Pierre,” said the
professor. “I had planned to take you down there
after our trip overland to Ponce. You wanted to
see an extinct volcano and there is a large one there
called Mont Pelee, only a few miles from the city.”</p>

<p>“Just the thing!” burst out Mark. “Let us
write letters at once and send them to St. Pierre, so
our fathers will be sure to get them on their arrival.”
And the letters were sent without delay.</p>

<p>Two days later found them on the ancient military
road which runs from San Juan to Ponce. The
direct distance from the principal seaport on the
north to the capital city on the south is only forty-five
miles, but the road is a winding one, running
from village to village and town to town, and by
this the journey becomes almost twice as long. At
many points the way is exceedingly hilly, so that fast<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>
traveling, especially in the hot sun, is out of the
question.</p>

<p>“We will take our time and make a week’s journey
of it,” said the professor. “That will give us
time to stop off at the various points of interest. We
shall go through the towns of Rio Piedras, Guaynabo,
Aguas Buenas, Caguas, Cayey, Aibonito,
Coamo, Juan Diaz, and others, and we may as well
take in all there is to see while we are at it.”</p>

<p>“I’d rather get down to Ponce and put in some
time there,” grumbled Hockley. “I understand
there is lots to see there.” He was anxious to have
a “good time” on the money he had received.</p>

<p>“We will have plenty of time at Ponce to see all
there is worth looking up,” answered Professor
Strong.</p>

<p>The boys had begged to be allowed to make the
journey on horseback, and the professor had consented,
and obtained the necessary steeds from the
best livery stable in San Juan. Darry wanted a
lively animal but Amos Strong shook his head.</p>

<p>“You’ve had runaways enough,” he said. “We
want to make this journey without accident.”</p>

<p>The day was a perfect one and they found the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>
first stage of the journey truly delightful. They
passed through a rolling country and not far away
were the mountains, with ridges sharply outlined
against the sky. Some of the boys wanted to gallop
ahead of the others but Amos Strong held them in
check.</p>

<p>“We must keep together,” he said. “I don’t
want any of you to get on the wrong road.”</p>

<p>In a couple of hours they passed through the
town of Rio Piedras, taking a look at the various
public buildings and at a large sugar mill which was
in the course of construction. It was midday and
the place looked deserted.</p>

<p>“Shall we remain here or push on to the next
place?” asked the professor.</p>

<p>“Let’s push on,” said Mark, and soon they were
on the way to Guaynabo, where they stopped for
dinner at a native house which was far from large
and not over clean. Yet a good meal was prepared
for them, and this they ate eagerly, for the ride
had given them an appetite.</p>

<p>Nightfall found them in the vicinity of Aguas
Buenas. They had stopped a dozen times on the
road, to look at the plantations, and once to assist<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>
a native whose ox cart had broken down. It had
begun to cloud up and now a few drops of rain
came down.</p>

<p>“We are in for a storm,” said Frank. “I reckon
we had best look for some sort of shelter.”</p>

<p>“Why not push on to the next town?” questioned
Sam.</p>

<p>“We can try it,” answered Professor Strong.
“But there is no use of our getting soaked.”</p>

<p>Tropical storms are apt to come up in a hurry, and
inside of a quarter of an hour it was raining in torrents.
They had crossed the bridge of a small stream
and now they found shelter under the shed of a long
warehouse which was old and empty.</p>

<p>“This is certainly a downpour,” remarked Professor
Strong, when they were out of it. “See how
the water is rushing along the roadway.”</p>

<p>He was right, the rain was coming down as if
there had been a cloudburst. There was a little
lightning and thunder, but not enough to cause
alarm. But the heavy fall of water made the very
roof of the old warehouse sag.</p>

<p>“I never saw the water come down like this before,”
observed the professor, as the downfall continued.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>
“It will certainly wash things out in the
valley.”</p>

<p>For over an hour the heavy fall of rain continued.
It was coming through the roof of the warehouse
and they had trouble in keeping even comparatively
dry. But now the thunder was rolling up to the
northward, and it slacked a trifle.</p>

<p>“Hark!” cried Sam, presently.</p>

<p>“What did you hear?” came from several of the
others.</p>

<p>“Thought I heard somebody calling for help.
Listen!”</p>

<p>They listened, and the cry was repeated. It came
from down a side trail which joined the highway
just in front of the old warehouse.</p>

<p>“Somebody is in trouble down there!” ejaculated
Mark. “Let us go and investigate.”</p>

<p>Without waiting to obtain permission from the
professor, he started down the side trail, with the
others following. The trail led downward into
something of a bottom, full of loose rocks, with here
and there a patch of mud.</p>

<p>“I see her!” cried Mark, presently, as he turned
a corner of the trail and came in sight of a wide<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
and shallow stream, backed up by a rocky hill and a
tangle of forest growth. “It’s a woman on a hut,
and she is in danger of drowning!”</p>

<p>Mark was right. In the middle of the wide stream
was a native hut which had been washed away from
somewhere and become lodged in between the rocks.
On the frail building, which looked as if it might
go to pieces at any instant, sat an old colored
woman, shrieking for help at the top of her voice.
The old woman had with her two children, a white
girl and a white boy of perhaps five or six years of
age, and to these she was clinging desperately.</p>

<p>“Save us! save us!” cried the colored woman,
in Spanish.</p>

<p>“We’ll do what we can,” called back the professor.
“Hold tight till we can get to you.”</p>

<p>“How are you going to get to her?” demanded
Hockley. “That water is running like mad.”</p>

<p>“I think we can leap from rock to rock,” suggested
Sam.</p>

<p>“Let’s take hold of hands,” came from Frank.</p>

<p>“One of you run back for that rope which we
saw at the warehouse,” said the professor, and
Hockley did so, for the lank youth had no desire to
risk his life in that foaming and dashing torrent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>It was no easy matter to leap from one rock to
the next, and Professor Strong and the boys advanced
with caution. The rain still came down,
keeping the footholds wet and blinding their eyesight.
Once Mark slipped and went into the stream,
but fortunately it was in a shallow where the water
only reached to his knees.</p>

<p>At last the hut was gained and with trembling
hands the old colored woman handed down first the
girl and then the boy. By this time Hockley had
returned with the rope, and this was passed out and
a line was formed.</p>

<p>“See the children safe first, do not mind me,”
said the old colored woman, and this was done, and
Mark took one while Sam took the other. Then
Frank and Professor Strong brought in the old colored
dame, who was so excited and exhausted that
she could scarcely stand. Once on the bank of the
stream the whole party made for the shelter of the
warehouse.</p>

<p>It was a long while before the colored woman
recovered sufficiently to speak. Then she said that
she was a nurse, and that she worked for a certain
Señor Alcamba, of Ponce. The two children were
the señor’s, his only beloved ones, since his wife had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>
died. The nurse had been traveling from one village
to another with them, when the storm had overtaken
her and she had resolved to remain for some hours at
the home of a friend. But she had lost her way in
the rain and sought shelter in the hut near the bank
of the stream. Without warning the rain had
washed the hut into the water and she had had a
desperate struggle to save the boy and the girl from
drowning. She had been almost ready to give up in
despair when the good <i>Americanos</i> had appeared.
She was very, very grateful and kissed their hands,
while tears of gratitude streamed down her fat
cheeks.</p>

<p>As it promised to keep on raining for at least several
hours it was decided that they should move on
to Aguas Buenas. The colored woman said she
could ride a horse and she was given Sam’s steed.
She carried the little girl, while the professor took
the boy. Sam hopped up behind Frank, and thus
the entire party reached the town mentioned a little
over an hour later. Accommodations were found at
a hotel which had just been established by a Porto
Rican and an American, and Professor Strong saw
to it that the colored woman and her charges were
looked after with care. The colored woman sent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>
out a messenger to look up some of her friends and
by nightfall a man came with a carriage and made
arrangements for taking her and the children away
early in the morning.</p>

<p>“I shall not forget you,” said the woman to Professor
Strong. “Señor Alcamba shall know of
your bravery and kindness, and he will surely reward
you.”</p>

<p>“We want no reward,” was the professor’s answer.
“We are glad to know that we were able to
assist you.”</p>

<small>ACROSS PORTO RICO ON HORSEBACK</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">By</span> the time the boys were stirring the next morning
the colored woman and the boy and girl were
gone. The storm had cleared away and the sun
was shining brightly. But out in the roadway and
in the garden attached to the hotel the traces of the
heavy downfall of rain were still in evidence.</p>

<p>“I see some beautiful flowers around here,” said
Mark, taking a walk with the professor before sitting
down to breakfast. “But a great number are
strange to me, and so are many of the vegetables and
fruits they use.”</p>

<p>“The vegetables mostly in use throughout the
island are white and sweet potatoes, carrots, turnips,
beets, radishes, cabbage, yams, yautias, cassava,
or tapioca, and okra root,” answered Professor
Strong. “There are many kinds of beans and peas
and also a great variety of squashes and pumpkins.
Of fruits the banana is, of course, the leader, but
Porto Rico pineapples are delicious and so are the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>
oranges and the cantelopes. Limes are much in use
for lime water. Lemons are raised for export.
There are also a vast number of shrubs and trees
which furnish medical extracts, and numerous dyewoods
are found here, including fustic, which gives
a yellow dye, divi-divi, which gives a reddish-brown
dye, mora, which gives bluing, and annotto, which
grows in great profusion and furnishes the peculiar
golden yellow often used in coloring butter and
cheese.”</p>

<p>“Gracious, I didn’t know they used coloring
here,” cried Mark.</p>

<p>“They use some, but I am sorry to say the most
of the butter coloring goes to the United States.
There are also trees here which produce a variety
of gums and resins, some of them very much in demand,
and which, consequently, bring fancy prices.”</p>

<p>“It’s certainly a land of plenty,” said Frank, who
had come up while the professor was speaking.
“The Porto Ricans ought to be happy.”</p>

<p>“They will be as soon as they have gotten used to
the new order of things, Frank. But I doubt if they
will ever get used to what we call hustling. They
are used to taking their own time about everything,
and the climate is against the strenuous life.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>The town of Aguas Buenas is perched high up on
the side of a mountain, with a broad valley lying
below,—where the flood had occurred. The place
is of small importance and contains little but
thatched huts, with here and there a building of
prominence. There is an old church, and a hotel
or two is springing up, ready to accommodate
the American tourist when he comes, and he
surely will come when this fine climate is better
known.</p>

<p>By nine o’clock they were again on the way heading
along the smooth road leading to Caguas, five
miles away. As they went down into the valley the
tropical vegetation became more luxurious than
ever, the out-spreading branches of palms and other
trees often brushing them as they passed.</p>

<p>“Not far away from here is a wonderful opening,”
said Professor Strong. “It is called Dark
Cave, and is said to extend over a mile underground.
I was never inside, but the interior is said to be very
beautiful.”</p>

<p>“Let us go and see it,” cried Frank.</p>

<p>“No, we haven’t time, and besides, it is said to be
a very dangerous cave to visit, on account of the
numerous pitfalls.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>As they journeyed along the professor pointed out
the Luquillo Mountains far to the eastward.</p>

<p>“That highest peak is Mount Yunque, the highest
peak on the island,” he said. “It has quite a
history. Years and years ago Porto Rico was swept
by hurricanes and earthquakes, and then the natives
thought that Mount Yunque was angry and did all
they could think of to appease the monster.”</p>

<p>They did not stop at Caguas but pushed on directly
for Cayey, fifteen miles to the south-westward.
They now passed numerous villages, each but a
collection of thatched huts, some standing directly
on the ground and others, near the water, on little
stilts. But few animals were visible outside of cows
and sheep. Of poultry there was a large quantity,
and at one spot they came upon a group of natives
watching a cock fight directly in the middle of the
road. The cocks had been fighting for some time,
evidently, for both were horribly wounded.</p>

<p>“What a barbarous custom!” exclaimed Sam,
with a shudder. “I hope that our government puts
a stop to that sport.”</p>

<p>“It will come in time, Samuel,” said the professor.
“But everything cannot be done at once.
As it is, I am glad there are no more bull fights.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>At the streams they passed they would often come
upon native women washing clothes and numerous
youngsters in bathing. Youngsters also filled the
roadway at certain villages, running and shouting in
their sport. The majority wore but little clothing,
and in some cases they acted as if even this
was a burden to them. A good many would
run away on seeing the Americans and shout
out in Spanish, “the shooters!” thinking of the
soldiers that had fought on the island during
the late war.</p>

<p>“This whole territory was in a state of suspense
during the war,” said Professor Strong. “The
army was under General Miles and an advance was
made from three different directions. The natives
were secretly in sympathy with our soldiers, but
Spain had many soldiers here and the natives were
forced to obey them. The fighting was stopped in
the midst of a battle, when a messenger appeared
with news that an armistice had been agreed upon.
Then, as you know, the war came to an end, and
some time later, Porto Rico was ceded by Spain to
the United States, along with the Philippines and
other islands of lesser importance.”</p>

<p>After a stop at Cayey over night they pushed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>
westward to Aibonito, a distance of ten miles further.
A gentle breeze was blowing into the valley
from the mountains, making the ride more delightful
than ever, and they visited several plantations in that
vicinity.</p>

<p>“This is the best of the weather to be met with
in Porto Rico,” observed the professor, as they
moved along at a walk, to take in the scenery
around them. “For a sick man nothing is better,
unless, of course, he needs the bracing air of a high
altitude. I think in years to come folks will come
here for their health just as they now go to Jamaica
and the Bermudas.”</p>

<p>At Aibonito the accommodations were very poor,
and late as it was they decided to push on to Coamo,
on the river by that name. This was a distance of
seven or eight miles, and Hockley growled at having
to ride so much further. But nobody paid attention
to him.</p>

<p>“He is getting to be a regular sore-head,” whispered
Frank to Mark. “If he keeps on I guess the
professor will have to take him in hand.”</p>

<p>“He hasn’t gotten over that trick on shipboard,”
replied Mark. “And he has received money. That
always puffs him up.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>“Do you think the professor knows about the
money?”</p>

<p>“I guess not. Glummy never shows his wad
when the professor is around. But he loves to
shove it under our noses,” added Mark.</p>

<p>All were thoroughly tired when Coamo was
reached and after supper were glad enough to retire.
They slept soundly, although Darry afterward declared
that he had been bitten almost to death by
fleas.</p>

<p>“Yes, Porto Rico has its full share of those
pests,” said Professor Strong, when told of this. “I
felt them myself. It is too bad, but there seems to be
no help for it. The natives will have to fight them
long and hard if they ever wish to get totally rid of
the pests.”</p>

<p>There was not much to see in Coamo outside of
the church and one or two small public buildings,
and some odd looking fishing smacks on the river,
and shortly after breakfast they started on the last
stage of their journey across the island. Their
course was now westward, through Juan Diaz,
where they stopped for another day, and towns of
lesser importance. For the greater portion of the
distance, the road here is not more than five miles<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>
from the sea, and at certain high points they could
catch glimpses of the rolling Caribbean, flashing
brightly in the sunlight. They crossed half a dozen
streams, and at last turned down the slope leading
into the outskirts of Ponce, named after the well-known
discoverer, Ponce de Leon.</p>

<p>“It’s certainly been a delightful trip,” was Sam’s
comment. “And we have seen a good deal of native
life. Much more than a fellow could see by rushing
past in a train—if there was a railroad.”</p>

<p>Ponce is situated about three miles north of the
harbor, in a wide plain surrounded by numerous
gardens and plantations. The boys could see numerous
churches and public buildings, and as they came
closer saw several fine hotels which have been
erected within the past two years.</p>

<p>“This is something like it,” said Darry, as he
smiled at the scene. “Is Ponce a very large place?”</p>

<p>“It has a population of about thirty thousand,”
answered the professor, “although newcomers are
drifting in from the States by every steamer. It
is a great shipping point for all islands south of this,
and, as you know, the terminus of one of the three
railroads of Porto Rico.”</p>

<p>Half an hour saw them in the center of the city,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>
at the hotel the professor had selected, a hostelry
very much like that they had stopped at in Havana.
The street was filled with people coming and going,
and venders were pushing their way this direction
and that, each with a wide board balanced on his
head, containing fruits, candies, or pastries. Around
at the side door of the hotel were several mules, each
carrying two trunks, strapped together and hung
over the beast’s sides. And over all a little native
boy was running along with a bundle of newspapers
under his arm shrieking at the top of his lungs:
“<i>Americano</i> news! Who buy de papair? <i>Americano</i>
newspapair!”</p>

<p>“Hurrah! At last we have struck the Porto
Rican cousin of the Bowery newsboy!” cried Frank.
“I declare, it makes a fellow feel quite at home.
Let’s buy some papers.” And they did, paying what
was equal to fifteen cents each for the sheets. They
were New York papers and nearly a week old, but
all were satisfied later on to sit down and read them
thoroughly.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXII<br>

<small>HOCKLEY IN TROUBLE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">On</span> the following morning all the boys, with the
exception of Hockley, were up bright and early.
They wanted to see as much as possible of Ponce,
for the professor assured them that the public buildings,
the ancient churches, and the parks and public
drives were all well worth visiting.</p>

<p>“I don’t want to go out,” said Hockley, when
called. “The horseback riding made me stiff. I’d
rather rest to-day,” and so, while the others spent
a day visiting a score of places, he was left behind to
do as he pleased.</p>

<p>The money he had received from his indulgent
father had been “burning a hole in his pocket,” to
use a common expression. He wanted a chance to
have a good time, and as soon as Professor Strong
and the others had departed he set out for that purpose.</p>

<p>“I’m going to do as I please after this,” he told<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>
himself. “And no Captain Sudlip shall get the
best of me either.”</p>

<p>Having finished his breakfast Hockley purchased
a package of cigarettes and then went to the café
for a “bracer.” He thought it quite manly to drink
a “bracer,” although he was in no need of the
liquor. To show off he paid for the drink out of a
twenty dollar bill he possessed and at the same time
took good care to show the roll of money he
carried.</p>

<p>The foolish boy did not realize that Ponce was
at this time filled with fortune hunters of all sorts,
men who had drifted in from the States and from
other places, all anxious to see if American rule of
the island would not give them some chance of
bettering their condition. Many of the fortune
hunters were hard working and honest, but there
was another sort, gamblers and those who lived by
their wits. These were the fellows to be met with
at the cafés and other drinking resorts.</p>

<p>Not far from where Hockley was standing stood
a man of about forty, stout, and dressed in a checked
suit of loud pattern. The man boasted of a profusion
of heavy jewelry, and from his shirt bosom
sparkled an immense “diamond”—of the sort<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>
which can be purchased in any large city for ten
or twenty-five cents. The man wore patent leather
boots, and his general appearance showed him to be
the sport that he was.</p>

<p>In an easy way he lounged up to Hockley. His
eye had noted the youth’s roll of bills and he made
up his mind that here was a possible victim. He
put his hand in his pocket and drew forth a large
dead bug.</p>

<p>“Excuse me,” he said, politely and reached for
Hockley’s collar. “It’s a pinching bug, I guess,”
and he threw the bug on the floor and crushed it
with his foot.</p>

<p>Of course Hockley thanked the stranger for his
kindness and then, as the latter was not drinking,
asked him to have something. The invitation was
promptly accepted, and in return the stranger also
treated.</p>

<p>“My name is Brown,” he said. “J. Rutherford
Brown, and I am from Montana. I take it you
are a newcomer in Ponce.”</p>

<p>“I am,” answered Hockley, and told his name
and mentioned the party of which he was a member.
“It’s rather slow, traveling around with those other
fellows,” he added. “I want to see some sport.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>“Of course,” rejoined J. Rutherford Brown, enthusiastically.
“I like a little sport myself.”</p>

<p>More talk followed, and in the end it was agreed
that the pair should go on a little trip of their own,
down the seashore, to a resort where, according to
the man from Montana, a “bang up, good, all
around time” could be had. “I’ll show you some
real life,” said J. Rutherford Brown. “Nothing
like it anywhere.”</p>

<p>They were soon on the way, in a carriage the
man from Montana insisted on engaging. The route
lay out of Ponce proper and along a seaside drive
to where some enterprising American hotel men had
erected several buildings, devoted partly to keeping
boarders but mostly to gambling.</p>

<p>The man from Montana had brought a flask of
liquor with him, and he insisted on treating, so
that by the time the resort he had in mind was
reached poor Hockley was in anything but a clear
state mentally. He felt strangely elated.</p>

<p>“This is all right,” he repeated several times.
“You’re a good fellow, Brown, a fine fellow. Glad
we met. You’ll lose nothing on me, no, sir. I’ve
got money, I have, and I mean to spend it.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right, but I insist on paying my own<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>
way,” answered J. Rutherford Brown, smoothly.
“I’ve got money myself.”</p>

<p>Once at the resort it was an easy matter for the
sharper to get Hockley into a side room, where the
pair were free from observation. In pulling a handkerchief
from his pocket, the man from Montana
let fall a pack of cards.</p>

<p>“Hullo, you play cards?” asked Hockley. “But
of course you do. So do I. Let’s have a game.”</p>

<p>J. Rutherford Brown was willing, indeed, he was
going to suggest a game himself, and having ordered
more liquor, and also a fine dinner, they sat down.
At first they played for fun. But then the man
from Montana spoke of a game in which he had
won five dollars, and poor, deluded Hockley at once
insisted they put up something. Thus the betting
started, at a dollar, and the youth was allowed to
win twenty times that sum.</p>

<p>“Told you I could do it,” said Hockley. “But
you shall have a chance to win it back directly after
dinner.” And after the meal the game began again,
and lasted the best part of two hours.</p>

<p>It is not my intention in these pages to describe
the manner in which Hockley was fleeced out of his
money, nearly a hundred and seventy-five dollars all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>
told. Let me say flatly that I do not approve of
gambling in any form, and the person who gambles
and loses his money deserves no sympathy. It is
a poor way in which to waste valuable time, and
money won at gambling rarely does the winner any
good. It is generally a case of “easy come and easy
go,” and with the coming and going the player loses
a self-respect which is hard to regain.</p>

<p>When the last game was played Hockley sat back
in a dazed, blank way. He had lost it all—every
dollar had passed into the hands of J. Rutherford
Brown. And not only his money but also his watch
and his ring, those precious gifts from his father
and his mother. At first he could not realize it.</p>

<p>“Gone!” he muttered hoarsely, and there was
almost a sob in his voice.</p>

<p>“Better luck next time,” returned the man from
Montana, cheerfully. And then he shoved a glass
of liquor at the foolish youth, who clutched and
drank it eagerly, in the hope of regaining his
“nerve.”</p>

<p>What happened immediately after that Hockley
could scarcely tell with certainty. He remembered
being helped into a carriage, and of taking a long
drive, and then all became a blank.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>When he came to his senses he sat up in a dazed
fashion. He knew nothing but that his head ached
as if it was going to split open and that his mouth
felt parched to the last degree.</p>

<p>“Where am I?” he muttered and stared around
him. On all sides were boxes and barrels, and he
had been lying on some of these, with some old
bagging for a pillow. Gradually it dawned upon
him that this was a warehouse and that the rising
sun was shining in at several of the long, slatted
windows. A strong smell of tobacco pervaded the
place.</p>

<p>“A tobacco warehouse,” he murmured, slowly.
“Now how did I come here and what makes my
head ache so?” He tried to collect his thoughts.
“I went out riding with that stranger and we had
a big dinner together, and then we played cards——”</p>

<p>He stopped short and felt into his pockets. They
were empty. Then he clutched his watch pocket
and felt of his finger upon which the ring had rested.
The full realization of what had occurred now burst
upon him, and his breath grew short while heavy
beads of perspiration stood out on his brow.</p>

<p>“Cleaned out!” he muttered. “Cleaned out, just
as I was cleaned out by Dan Market! Oh, what a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>
fool I’ve been!” And tears of rage filled his eyes,
while he pounded his fist on the top of a barrel.
Then he leaped up and shook the fist in the air.</p>

<p>“But he shan’t get the best of me! I’ll make him
square up if I have to go to the police and tell
everybody! He shan’t get the best of me!”</p>

<p>His hat had rolled to the floor, and putting it
on he hurried to the warehouse door, which was unlocked.
Beyond was a dock extending to the waterfront
and close at hand was a road leading to the
city, four miles away. A cart was passing and he
hailed the driver. By signs and a few words of
broken Spanish he let the cart driver know he
wanted to get to Ponce as soon as possible and the
native made room for him on the rough seat.</p>

<p>The drive in the early morning air did Hockley
good, and by the time the cart rattled along on the
uneven pavements of the city the lank youth felt
somewhat like himself. At a public fountain he left
the native and got a drink. Possibly the native expected
pay for his service, but if so he was disappointed,
and he drove on looking as if such were
his feeling.</p>

<p>Now that he felt a little better Hockley sat down<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>
in one of the city parks to review the situation. It
was all well enough to go after J. Rutherford
Brown and have him arrested, but what would Professor
Strong say to the whole proceedings?</p>

<p>“Hang the professor!” he exclaimed, and gave
the park bench a savage kick with his foot. “I’m
going to have satisfaction. I’m going to catch that
fellow and make him give up my money and things
if I die for it!”</p>

<p>Leaving the park he espied an American, and
from this man received directions which speedily
took him to the café where he had first met J.
Rutherford Brown. Going inside, he asked for
the man.</p>

<p>“Haven’t seen him this morning,” replied the
keeper of the resort.</p>

<p>“Do you know where he lives?” went on Hockley.
“It’s a matter of importance to him,” he went
on, shrewdly.</p>

<p>“He has a room at the Snug Corner, I believe.”</p>

<p>“Where is that?”</p>

<p>“Three squares up the street, on the corner.”</p>

<p>Waiting to hear no more, Hockley strode out and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>
up the street in the direction indicated. It was
now ten o’clock, and he had had no breakfast, but
just then he had no thought of eating.</p>

<p>Walking into the corridor of the hotel he glanced
around. Only a few people were present. Then
he glanced into the smoking and reading room.</p>

<p>His heart gave a bound. J. Rutherford Brown
was there, smoking contentedly. He had his feet
cocked up on a table and was reading a newspaper.</p>

<p>Going up to the man from Montana, Hockley tore
the newspaper from his grasp.</p>

<p>“You villain, you!” he cried, wrathfully. “You
swindled me!”</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXIII<br>

<small>THE BULLY IS HUMBLED</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Many</span> a man would have been startled by such
a direct accusation, but J. Rutherford Brown had
been in a similar position before and was not to be
scared thus easily. He turned slowly, put his feet
on the floor and gazed coldly at Hockley.</p>

<p>“Young man, you are mistaken,” he said. “And
if you dare to repeat your words you will be sorry.”</p>

<p>“But I say—” went on the youth, and then the
look in the eyes of the man made him pause. It was
a merciless, crafty face that peered into his own and
it made Hockley shiver in spite of himself.</p>

<p>“We had several fair and square games of cards,”
went on the man from Montana. “And you lost
your money. Don’t be a calf to cry over it. If
you are in hard luck say so, and I’ll—well, I’ll lend
you ten dollars.”</p>

<p>As he concluded J. Rutherford Brown calmly
took from his hip pocket a big roll of bills—a large<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>
portion of them Hockley’s bills—and drew forth
one of the denomination mentioned.</p>

<p>“Do you want this?” he asked, extending the
bill between the tips of his fingers.</p>

<p>“Ye—yes,” stammered the youth, and took it.
“But—but——”</p>

<p>“I don’t want to talk over the affair of yesterday,”
interrupted the man. “If you will remember,
I lost something before the luck turned. If
you had quit the game then, I should not have
squealed. Besides that, I took you away, so that
you would not get into trouble while you slept. I
spent ten dollars for carriage fare, but we will let
that pass.”</p>

<p>Having thus delivered himself, J. Rutherford
Brown hoisted his feet to the table once more and
resumed the reading of his newspaper. Hockley
looked at him in amazement not unmixed with consternation.
He had never before met such a fellow
as this. He did not know how to proceed, and
walked away revolving the situation in his mind.</p>

<p>The more he thought it over, the more Hockley
became convinced that he could do little or nothing.
Of course, if it came to the pinch, J. Rutherford
Brown would deny everything, and as there were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>
no witnesses to what had occurred, legal proof would
be hard to obtain.</p>

<p>“I’ve been a chump,” he muttered as he walked
out of the hotel. “A downright chump.”</p>

<p>As there seemed nothing else to do, he turned his
footsteps in the direction of the hotel at which the
professor and the other boys were stopping. His
heart felt like lead in his bosom and he could not
for the life of him conjure up what to say. He
knew that excuses would be unavailing, that Professor
Strong would insist upon making a rigid investigation.</p>

<p>As he turned a corner leading to the hotel he
came face to face with Professor Strong, who was
walking with another man, a native hired to show
the party the sights.</p>

<p>“Jacob Hockley,” cried the professor. “Where
have you been? We have been hunting everywhere
for you.”</p>

<p>“It’s a long story, sir,” answered Hockley,
meekly. “And if you please, I’d like to get breakfast
before I tell it.”</p>

<p>“So you have had nothing to eat? Then come
to the hotel by all means. But where have you
been?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>“Out of town, a good many miles, I guess.”</p>

<p>“Out of town?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. And I’ve lost the most of my money,”
went on the lank youth, desperately.</p>

<p>“How did you lose that?” And now Professor
Strong’s face grew stern.</p>

<p>Hockley felt a certain quaking within him. It
would never do to say that he had been playing
cards—worse, that he had been gambling. Professor
Strong had read the young travelers more
than one lecture on evils of this sort.</p>

<p>“I—I got in a crowd and somehow I either lost
the money or it was taken from me,” stammered the
bully. “But please don’t tell the others,” he went
on. “They’ll only have the laugh on me.”</p>

<p>“Just give me the details,” said Professor Strong,
briefly, and then Hockley had to invent a long tale
of how he had gone carriage riding down to the
seashore and how, while he was getting a lunch
at a restaurant, there had been a horse runaway and
he had gone out to see the excitement.</p>

<p>“There was more of a crowd than I thought,” he
continued. “I was shoved around by a policeman
and a number of natives. I had been counting my
money and when the excitement began I rammed it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>
in my hip pocket. When I went back to the eating
place the money was gone.”</p>

<p>“And what made you remain away all night?”</p>

<p>“It was growing dark when the runaway happened
and I thought I could find the money this
morning. But I didn’t find anything.”</p>

<p>“Humph! How about your watch and that ring
you are in the habit of wearing?”</p>

<p>Hockley felt a certain cold chill steal over him.
In his haste to smooth matters over he had forgotten
about the watch and the ring.</p>

<p>“They—er—they got lost too,” he said, lamely,
his face growing very red.</p>

<p>“Quite likely,” was Professor Strong’s comment.
“Come with me. We will get to the bottom of this
later on—after you have had something to eat.”</p>

<p>Hockley was hungry, but eating breakfast came
very hard to him that morning. As soon as he had
finished Professor Strong plied him with questions,
and at last he broke down and confessed all—how
he had received the money order from home and
how he had started out to have a little quiet fun,
as he called it. And then, when the professor insisted
that he take him to the spot where the runaway
had occurred, he had to admit that there had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>
been no runaway but that he had fallen into the
hands of a sharper, and that the sharper now had
all the money excepting ten dollars and the amount
spent for the dinner.</p>

<p>“I am sure he drugged me,” said Hockley,
weakly. “He wouldn’t have gotten the money from
me if he hadn’t.”</p>

<p>“I will see the man,” returned Professor Strong,
shortly, and insisted that the youth show the way
to where J. Rutherford Brown might be found.</p>

<p>The man from Montana stood upon the hotel
steps, just preparatory to going on a hunt for another
victim. He was smoking a black-looking
cigar. He felt particularly elated, for between Hockley
and a victim picked up two days before he had
come into the possession of over three hundred
dollars. To be sure, this was no fortune, especially
to one supposed to own valuable gold mines in the
West, but to J. Rutherford Brown, who had often
had less than a dollar in his pockets, it was a considerable
sum.</p>

<p>“Don’t think I’ll stay here much longer,” he
mused, as he puffed away. “That boy or that man
from Philadelphia may turn up and make trouble.
Guess I’ll go back to San Juan.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span>“There is the fellow!” cried Hockley, to Professor
Strong. “The man with the checked suit,
who is smoking.”</p>

<p>The professor took a good look and then he
smiled grimly to himself. “I fancy we are in
luck,” he said, briefly. “I know this fellow.”</p>

<p>“You do?” ejaculated Hockley. “Who is he?”</p>

<p>Professor Strong did not answer, but going up
to the man from Montana clapped him on the arm.</p>

<p>“So we meet again, Henry Umbler,” he said.</p>

<p>The man who had called himself J. Rutherford
Brown gave a start and his face changed color.
Then he recovered and endeavored to put on a bold
front.</p>

<p>“You are mistaken, sir. My name is not Umbler,”
he said.</p>

<p>“We won’t argue the point, Umbler. I want you
to pay back to this young man the money you took
from him.”</p>

<p>“Don’t know him, sir. You are making a mistake.”</p>

<p>“Are you sure of this fellow?” questioned Professor
Strong of Hockley.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” was the prompt answer.</p>

<p>“Then, Umbler, you must give up the money,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>
every cent of it. Please to remember that you are
in United States territory now—not in Brazil, where
you were when last we met. I fancy some stockholders
of the International Star Rubber Company
would be glad to get their hands on Henry Umbler,
one of the promoters of that get-rich-quick concern.”</p>

<p>“I tell you I am not Henry Umbler,” insisted the
man from Montana.</p>

<p>“Very well then. We’ll go to police headquarters
and settle this affair.”</p>

<p>“What do you want?”</p>

<p>“I want this young man’s money, his watch and
his ring returned to him.”</p>

<p>“What is he to you?”</p>

<p>“I brought him down here to see the sights,—and
I am bound to see that he is not swindled. Give
him back his money and other things and I will not
prosecute you, but if you refuse, I’ll see to it that
he not only gets his money but that you go back to
the West, where you belong.”</p>

<p>At this plain talk the face of the swindler became
a study. At last he turned and faced Hockley.</p>

<p>“We had a fair game,” he growled. “You’re
a baby to squeal, nothing but a baby. But if you
want the money you can have it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>He brought a roll of bills out of his pocket, and
began to count out a sum equal to that the youth
had possessed. With this, and the watch and ring,
in his hand he looked again at Professor Strong.</p>

<p>“If I give him this does that close the whole affair?”
he asked.</p>

<p>“Yes, so far is I am concerned,” answered Amos
Strong.</p>

<p>“Then here you are, baby,” went on the man
from Montana, and thrust the money and other
things into Hockley’s willing hand. “Don’t ever
try to be a sport again. You’re only fit to be let
loose in a kindergarten.” And then he walked away,
puffing at his black cigar more furiously than ever.</p>

<p>“Who is he?” questioned Hockley, as he put the
money away, after counting it.</p>

<p>“He is a Western sharp,” replied the professor.
“Years ago he was mixed up in a stock company
that proved to be little better than a swindle. I
had some shares in it but managed to get my money
back. I tried to help others in the company, but
they wouldn’t listen to my plan and went ahead on
their own account and lost. I met Umbler in Brazil
once and tried to get more money out of him, for
the other stockholders, but he laughed at me, for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>
at that time it would have been a hard matter to
have a man transported from Brazil to the United
States on such a charge as I could make.”</p>

<p>“I—I am much obliged for getting the money
back, sir.”</p>

<p>“It was rare good luck, Jacob, nothing else, and
now you have it again I want you to turn it over
to me.”</p>

<p>“But, sir——.”</p>

<p>“I will not argue the matter.” Professor Strong’s
voice grew stern once more. “You can either give
the money to me, or pack your trunk and go home.
And if you get into any more such scrapes I shall
notify your father and send you home anyway. I
want no more gambling and no more ‘seeing the
sights’ on your own account. You have got to turn
over a new leaf.”</p>

<p>For half an hour Amos Strong “laid down the
law” to Hockley and at the end of that time the
bully felt very humble indeed. He did not wish to
be sent home, and he promised faithfully to do better
in the future; and there the affair was dropped.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXIV<br>

<small>SOMETHING ABOUT EARTHQUAKES AND VOLCANOES</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">For</span> four days the boys traveled around Ponce
with the professor, taking in all the sights. They
also took a trip on the railroad to Guayanilla and
Yauco, and likewise down to several small villages
along the seacoast. They were particularly interested
in the American government of the island,
and spent several hours at the various departments.
Here the professor met two officials whom he knew,
and all were made to feel thoroughly at home.</p>

<p>In those trips Hockley had little to say, and the
other boys noticed the change in his manner.</p>

<p>“Something went wrong, that’s certain,” observed
Darry. But what it had been they could
not imagine, for neither Hockley nor the professor
said anything, and they did not dare to make inquiries.</p>

<p>At the close of the fourth day a French steamer
came into the Port of Ponce, bound from Hayti to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>
St. Pierre, Martinique. The steamer was one upon
which Amos Strong had sailed once before and he
knew Captain Danvier fairly well. He at once communicated
this fact to the boys.</p>

<p>“If we are to go down to Martinique we cannot
do better than sail with Captain Danvier,” he said.
“His steamer, the <i>Vendee</i>, is a comfortable craft,
and we shall be certain of good food and pleasant
company.”</p>

<p>“Then let us sail by all means,” said Mark, who
was anxious to get to St. Pierre and see his father,
and Frank said the same. Sam and Darry were likewise
willing, and so, for a wonder was Hockley.
As a matter of fact the tall youth had wished to get
away from Ponce long before, being fearful that the
other boys might learn something about J. Rutherford
Brown, <i>alias</i> Henry Umbler, and of the loss of
money by gambling.</p>

<p>The matter of accommodations on board of the
<i>Vendee</i> was easily arranged with Captain Danvier,
who was delighted to meet Professor Strong again,
and twenty-four hours later the party bid farewell to
the Port of Ponce and sailed for the island which
was destined so soon to become the center of one of
the largest catastrophes known to history.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>“I guess we have quite a sail before us,” said
Sam, after land had become hidden in the distance.</p>

<p>“We have, Samuel,” answered the professor.
“Roughly speaking, the distance from Ponce to St.
Pierre is a little over four hundred miles. We shall
sail directly to the south-east, and make no stops on
the way. The <i>Vendee</i> is not a fast steamer, but
Captain Danvier calculates to cover the distance in
five days.”</p>

<p>“I have been looking up a map of the Leeward
Islands,” put in Mark. “What a lot of them there
are and all in a row, like the tops of a mountain
range.”</p>

<p>“And that is just what they are, Mark, and the
tops of a very high range of mountains at that, only
the water covers the larger part of the range. Between
some of these islands and to the east and west
the water is five and six thousand feet deep. If
the sea was swept away some of these peaks would
be two miles high.”</p>

<p>“They must have had some terrible earthquakes
and volcanic eruptions to produce such mountains,”
said Darry, who had joined the group.</p>

<p>“They have had, Dartworth, and these eruptions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>
have extended not alone through the Leeward
Islands, but through the whole of the West Indies
and also through Central and South America and
parts of Mexico.”</p>

<p>“Do you know, I have never read much about
earthquakes and volcanoes,” observed Mark. “But
it seems to me it ought to prove interesting reading.”</p>

<p>“It is interesting—more so than any novel you
ever read. Earthquakes alone have enlisted the attention
of scientists for years, and they have to-day
the record of over seven thousand which proved
more or less disastrous.”</p>

<p>“Seven thousand!” cried Darry. “Then old
Mother Earth isn’t as fixed as I thought her!”</p>

<p>“No, Mother Earth is not fixed, but continually
changing, both inside and out. There are tremendous
fires on the interior and these often crack open
the dirt and rock, letting in large quantities of sea-water.
Then comes an explosion, just as you may
have at home if you throw cold water into a red-hot
kitchen range. The steam and gases don’t know
where to go, and consequently there is a volcanic
eruption, or else something breaks loose underground
and an earthquake follows. If this happens<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>
close to the sea, or under the sea, there is a tidal
wave, the water going down and up with the movements
of the ocean bed.”</p>

<p>“Do all earthquakes come from volcanic fires?”
asked Sam.</p>

<p>“We cannot answer that, Samuel. Some earthquakes
seem not to have any connection with volcanoes,
as for instance the earthquake at Charleston,
South Carolina, in 1886. There was no fire there,
and but little gas, and what caused the quaking,
with its tremendous damage to property and human
life, is a mystery.”</p>

<p>“What was the very worst earthquake known?”
came from Frank.</p>

<p>“That at Lisbon, Portugal, in 1755. It happened
late in the year, and before it occurred there
were numerous small earthquakes and volcanic outbursts
throughout Europe. When the big earthquake
came there were three shocks in quick succession
and the very bottom of the harbor dropped
out. After many ships were engulfed, the bottom
of the harbor came up again and there was a fierce
onrush of water. What was left standing of the
city took fire, and fully fifty thousand people lost
their lives.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>“Isn’t Vesuvius the largest of all known volcanoes?”
asked Darry.</p>

<p>“It is certainly the most destructive of volcanoes,
having destroyed Pompeii by covering it with a fine
dust, until it was completely buried from sight, and
having covered Herculaneum with a shower of mud,
so that hardly a soul escaped from a territory miles
in extent. But the largest volcano in the world is
probably Krakatua, situated between the islands of
Sumatra and Java, in the East Indies. This volcano
was first heard of in 1860, but its greatest
outbreak occurred in 1883. At first there was a
tremendous column of vapor over the island, which,
fortunately, was uninhabited. This increased, and
explosion after explosion was heard, each growing
louder than the others. These explosions finally got
so terrific that they were heard thousands of miles
away, and the inhabitants of Java, Sumatra, and
other islands in that vicinity were filled with terror.
At last, late in August, came one grand explosion in
the morning, and about eight square miles of dirt
and rock were hurled into the air, to fall into the
hissing and boiling sea. The gas, dust, and noxious
vapors traveled for miles and obscured the sun like<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>
an eclipse, and the tidal waves rose to a height of
sixty to ninety feet, causing the loss of much
shipping and probably forty thousand lives. Had
Krakatua been on the mainland instead of on an
island there would probably have been such a catastrophe
as is unknown to modern history.”</p>

<p>“I’m glad I wasn’t there,” put in Hockley, who
had lounged up during the talk, and felt that he
must say something. “I’m willing enough to stay
where there are no earthquakes and volcanoes.”</p>

<p>“What about the volcanoes down here?” asked
Mark. “You said something about Mont Pelee, on
the island of Martinique.”</p>

<p>“That is now supposed to be an extinct volcano.
It was in eruption in 1813, 1817, 1823, 1839 and
1851. The eruption of 1839 was the worst and this
nearly destroyed Fort de France, the capital of the
island. The volcano is forty-two hundred feet in
height and several miles in circumference. The last
time I stopped at St. Pierre there was an excursion
formed to visit the crater of the mountain, which
now forms a beautiful lake of unknown depth. We
spent a day in looking around and took dinner at a
fine hotel at the foot of Pelee.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>“Are there any other volcanoes on the island?”</p>

<p>“There is Mount Carbet, near the center of the
island, and Mount Vauclin near the south-east extremity,
but they are of small importance.”</p>

<p>“We must visit all the volcanoes!” cried Frank.
“I want to see what they look like on the inside.”</p>

<p>“I thought there was a big volcano on the
Hawaiian Islands,” put in Hockley.</p>

<p>“There is, Jacob, Kilauea, which is nine miles in
circumference, and one of the largest in the world.
But this has never shown the activity of Vesuvius
or of some others. There is also a volcano on the
island of St. Vincent, due south of Martinique,
which is well worth visiting.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t care to see them—at least, not if
there is any danger of their shooting off,” added
the tall youth, hastily, and in such a manner that
the others could scarcely keep from laughing.</p>

<p>“We will try to avoid all eruptions,” replied the
professor, smiling, for even he did not dream of
what was so close at hand.</p>

<p>The boys found Captain Danvier just as sociable
as Amos Strong had pictured him, and the worthy
commander of the <i>Vendee</i> gave them permission to
roam over the steamer at will. He could speak<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>
English fairly well and took a delight in explaining
his nautical instruments and other things to them.</p>

<p>“’Tis verra nice for you to do ze traveling
around,” he said. “And wid such a learned gentlemans
as ze professair it is von double pleasure.
He is ze fine gentlemans, I know heem well.”</p>

<p>“And so do we know him,” answered Darry.
“He’s O. K.”</p>

<p>“O. K. Vot you means by zat?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I mean he is just the cheese,” said Darry,
bound to have his fun.</p>

<p>The French captain looked more bewildered than
ever. “De cheese? Ha, you mean de cheese to
eat—de <i>caise</i>. But you no mean to eat him, no.”</p>

<p>“No, I mean he is just the ticket.”</p>

<p>“De ticket, vot is dat? De <i>carte</i>, eh? How is
de professair de <i>carte</i>?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t say the professor was a card—or a bill
of fare either. I mean he is just all right.”</p>

<p>“All right? Ha, I see—<i>oui, oui</i>! Surely he is
all right, de professair is nevair wrong. But while
he is right how can he be de ticket and de cheese,
and de O. K.? Dat Englis as she is spoke by de
American is von verra funny language, yes!” And
the French captain shrugged his shoulders, while<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>
Darry and the other boys had to turn away to keep
from laughing in the good-hearted man’s face. But
when Darry and Mark tried to air the little French
they knew before Captain Danvier he laughed as
heartily as they did.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXV<br>

<small>A COLLISION AT SEA</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">On</span> the second day on shipboard Professor Strong
produced a map of the Leeward Islands, and told
the boys something more concerning the island they
were to visit.</p>

<p>“As you will see by the map,” he said, “Martinique
is irregular in shape. Roughly speaking it is
forty miles long by from ten to fifteen miles wide.
The area is less than four hundred square miles, and
a good portion of this is rocky and unfit for cultivation.”</p>

<p>“I see Mont Pelee, in the north,” said Mark,
studying the map.</p>

<p>“The principal cities are Fort de France, the
capital, located on the bay of the same name, and
St. Pierre and Lamentin. These three cities are,
as you see, located on the western coast of the island.
On the eastern coast is François, a town which has
quite a respectable shipping. The total population
of the island is about two hundred thousand, mostly
negroes, half-castes, and French.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>“What do they raise there?” came from Sam.</p>

<p>“Sugar mostly, although there is also some tobacco
and also a few cattle. On an island so narrow,
the streams, of course, cannot be of much importance.
The place was discovered by Columbus
in 1502 and was first settled by the French, and it
is a French colony to-day. I have been at both Fort
de France and St. Pierre and found them progressive
in their way. Each contains from twenty-five to
thirty thousand inhabitants and boasts of a number
of fine parks and public buildings. Just outside of
St. Pierre is a suburb in which the wealthy French
population have some beautiful residences. The
drive to this district is delightful.”</p>

<p>“And how far is Mont Pelee from the city?”
asked Sam.</p>

<p>“The volcano is five miles north of St. Pierre.
The country is very hilly, but there are several
routes by which the crater of the volcano can be
reached with ease. There are a few small rivers to
cross but these are all bridged. Just north of St.
Pierre is a large sugar refinery. The city itself lies
right along the waterfront, with high hills directly
behind it.”</p>

<p>After this the talk became general and the professor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span>
told them of his former visits to Martinique,
and also to the islands of Guadeloupe, Dominica,
St. Lucia, St. Vincent and Grenada, others of the
group. He told them there might be little or no
hunting in store for them, but a good deal of mountain
climbing, and volcano exploring if they desired
it. And they said they did, all but Hockley, who,
as usual hung back for something else, he could not
tell what.</p>

<p>For two days the weather remained fine and the
time passed swiftly enough, but on the morning of
the third day the sky clouded up and by noon it was
raining in torrents. Then the wind came up and the
little steamer had all she could do to keep to
her course.</p>

<p>The first effect of the storm was to drive everybody
to the cabin. Windows and doors were bolted
and ports secured, and the passengers kept their feet
with difficulty as they moved around. Eating at the
table was almost impossible, and the professor had a
dish of peas upset in his lap, while Hockley nearly
choked himself with a cup of coffee which went up
his nose and into his eyes. Mark was also unfortunate.
He was trying to eat a bit of steak but it
slipped from his plate to his knee and then the whole<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>
length of the dining room floor. A waiter stepped
on it and went headlong, bringing down an armful
of dishes with a mighty crash.</p>

<p>“Say! but this is a storm and no mistake!” gasped
Mark, after the laughing had subsided. “And
such a nice piece of beefsteak, too.”</p>

<p>“We’re lucky if we don’t all go to the bottom!”
sighed Hockley. And then he made a rush from
the room to his stateroom. He had been taken seasick
and was perfectly miserable from that time
until the storm cleared away.</p>

<p>Toward evening the rain let up a bit, and as it
was very close and stuffy in the cabin, the boys
begged Professor Strong to let them go on deck.
He finally consented, but warned them to take good
care and not fall overboard.</p>

<p>“This is a treacherous sea,” he said. “The
waves sometimes run very high when least expected.
Hold on tight, no matter where you happen to be
standing.”</p>

<p>“All right, we’ll be careful,” said Sam.</p>

<p>They went on deck and secured a position close
by the wheelhouse, where a number of life-lines had
been stretched. Captain Danvier was present and
also warned them to be on guard.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span>“Ze waves run verra high,” he said. “You must
hold on hard, <i>oui</i>, verra hard.”</p>

<p>An hour went by, and the storm seemed on the
point of subsiding altogether. Feeling they could
now walk around a little, the boys moved from one
end of the steamer to the other with caution. The
deck was still slippery and it was now dark.</p>

<p>Important events sometimes happen with alarming
swiftness and such proved to be the case in the
present instance. It had looked as if the storm
was about at an end, but without warning there
came another blow, which sent the spray flying in
all directions. The lookouts were drenched and for
the moment could see nothing. Then as the spray
cleared away for an instant, one of them gave a
mad yell in French:</p>

<p>“A ship! A ship dead ahead!”</p>

<p>The cry had hardly pierced the air when there
came a tremendous shock which shook the <i>Vendee</i>
from stem to stern and caused the steamer to list
well over to port. Sam and Darry, who had started
back for the cabin, to change their wet jackets,
were pitched headlong and bumped into each other
close to a post.</p>

<p>“Oh!” groaned Sam.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span>“Are you hurt, Beans?” questioned Darry, catching
his chum by the shoulder.</p>

<p>“A little. What was that struck us?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know.”</p>

<p>Another cry now came out of the darkness. But
it was in French and they could not understand it.
Then some sailors rushed past them with a large
square of canvas and some ropes.</p>

<p>“We have been struck and they are going to cover
the hole with sailcloth,” explained another passenger,
who could speak both French and English.
“What we struck nobody knows excepting that it
was some kind of vessel.”</p>

<p>With difficulty the two boys gained their feet
and ran for the cabin. At the doorway both halted
and each gazed at the other in consternation.</p>

<p>“Mark and Frank!” burst out Darry. “Where
are they?”</p>

<p>“I’m sure I don’t know,” responded Sam, in equal
dismay. He raised his voice: “Frank! Mark! Are
you safe?” he called out.</p>

<p>No answer came back, and now Professor Strong
rushed up, fully as alarmed as anybody.</p>

<p>“Are you all right?” he questioned. “Where
are Mark and Frank?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[249]</span>“We don’t know, sir,” answered Sam.</p>

<p>“They were on deck with you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“Pray heaven they haven’t gone overboard,”
gasped Amos Strong, and greatly agitated, he ran
out into the darkness of the deck. Then they heard
him call back: “Remain in the cabin until I return.”</p>

<p>A dozen cries now resounded on every side, and
bells were jangling almost as wildly. The <i>Vendee</i>
had been struck on the starboard side, just aft of
the bow, and the captain was ordering some of the
cargo to be shifted to the stern, that the bow might
come up as far as possible out of the water. In
the meantime the ship’s carpenter had got out the
sailcloth and he and his men were lowering it over
the hole, to keep out the rush of water. Below, the
pump had been connected with the engine and this
was already battling bravely to free the hold of the
briny element that threatened to send the gallant
steamer to the bottom.</p>

<p>In the midst of the excitement Hockley appeared.
He saw that this was no “fake” sinking, and his
face was pale with terror as he clung first to Sam
and then to Darry.</p>

<p>“It’s awful!” he wailed. “What shall we do?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span>
Where are the life preservers? Where is the professor?
Why don’t he order out a boat to save us?
How far do you suppose we are from land? Oh,
I know I can’t swim in such a sea!” And he shook
like a leaf.</p>

<p>“We are not going down yet, Jake,” answered
Sam. “The professor is looking for Mark and
Frank. I’m afraid they’ve been washed overboard.”</p>

<p>“There is a signal of distress!” interrupted
Darry, pointing out through the darkness. A rocket
had flared through the air, and now another followed.
Then a strong Bengal light lit up the scene.</p>

<p>“I’m going out to look for Frank and Mark,”
said Darry, recklessly, and left the cabin. Sam
came close behind him. Hockley did not wish to
go, but to remain alone seemed even worse and he
also followed, but more slowly.</p>

<p>The <i>Vendee</i> had been backed and was now coming
up alongside of the ship with which it had been
in collision. The strong Bengal light showed her
to be a three masted schooner, piled high with lumber.
A good part of the lumber on the forward deck
had been unshipped by the collision and was floating
in the angry sea.</p>

<p>“Do you see anything of Mark and Frank?”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span>
asked Sam, hoarsely, as he and Darry slipped up
beside the professor.</p>

<p>“Not a sign,” was the sad answer. “If they
were washed overboard I fear they were drowned.”</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t say that!” gasped Darry. “Drowned!
It’s horrible!”</p>

<p>“Can’t they put out a small boat?” asked Sam.</p>

<p>“No small boat would live in such a sea as this,
and besides with so much loose lumber floating
around it would be doubly dangerous to try going
out.”</p>

<p>“But what are we going to do?” demanded
Hockley. “I—I don’t want to drown just yet.”</p>

<p>“I don’t imagine this steamer is going down,
Jacob. We received a heavy blow, it is true, but
she is built in a number of compartments. My
whole anxiety, is for Mark and Frank. If they
went overboard they must be lost.”</p>

<p>“Well, it was their business to take care of themselves,”
grumbled the tall youth, unfeelingly.</p>

<p>“And it is your business to look out for yourself,”
retorted Darry. “But don’t let us quarrel;
this thing is far too serious,” he added.</p>

<p>The Bengal light had now burnt itself out and no
more were lit for the reason that the storm was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span>
again coming up and the crew of each vessel had to
bestow their entire attention to the question of
saving the craft from going down. This was comparatively
an easy matter on board of the <i>Vendee</i>
and soon under officers were sent around to assure
the passengers that there was no immediate cause
for alarm, that the hole had been patched up temporarily,
and that it would be thoroughly repaired
as soon as the wind abated.</p>

<p>Captain Danvier was extremely sorry to hear that
two of the boys were missing and at once did what
he could toward finding them. But in such a storm,
which was again increasing, his first duty was to
his ship, and he said, as had Professor Strong, that
to risk a small boat in such a sea would be foolhardy.</p>

<p>“We must wait until daylight,” he said, in
French. “I can do nothing now.”</p>

<p>Slowly the night wore away. Nobody slept, and
at the first streak of dawn all went on deck. The
storm had passed, but the sky was still dark. The
captain had thought best to lay to, thinking the
lumber schooner might need assistance. The other
craft was not far away and soon they came within
hailing distance of each other. The lumber boat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[253]</span>
flew the Dutch flag and proved to be bound from
Saba to Curaçao.</p>

<p>“I have lost a large quantity of lumber!” roared
the Dutch skipper, wrathfully. “I shall hold you
responsible in law for it!”</p>

<p>“Have you seen anything of two boys?” questioned
Captain Danvier. “We have lost them.”</p>

<p>“No, I have seen no boys. Have you seen a
man? We lost one of our sailors in that smash.”</p>

<p>“No, we have seen nobody,” answered the French
captain.</p>

<p>“It was your fault we had that smash,” the
Dutch skipper continued. “Remember, I shall hold
you for it in law, the first chance I get!”</p>

<p>“Do as you please about that,” returned Captain
Danvier, coolly. “You are as much to blame as
myself. But if you see anything of those boys
treat them well and you’ll lose nothing by it.”</p>

<p>“I’ll treat them well enough,” growled the Dutch
skipper.</p>

<p>As the Dutchman could speak neither French nor
English the conversation had to be carried on in
his native tongue and it was hard for Captain
Danvier to make himself understood. Only a few
words more passed, and then the two vessels separated,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span>
and the lumber schooner proceeded on her
way, with every sail set.</p>

<p>“It ees certainly verra sad,” said the French captain,
to the professor and the boys. “I vill do what
I can for ze boys—but what is zare to do, tell me
zat?”</p>

<p>“I wish you would remain in this vicinity for
a day or so,” answered Professor Strong. “They
may be floating around, and if so I hope to pick
them up.”</p>

<p>The captain agreed readily, and not one day but
two were spent in the vicinity. In the meantime
the hole in the bow was repaired, so that danger
from that source became a thing of the past.</p>

<p>The loss of Mark and Frank made Sam, Darry
and Professor Strong feel much downcast and even
Hockley went around looking very sober.</p>

<p>“I never dreamed that such a dreadful thing
would happen,” said Darry, and there were tears in
his eyes. “I declare, if they don’t turn up I’m going
right back home.”</p>

<p>“And I am with you,” answered Sam. “To go
sight-seeing without them would make me sick.”</p>

<p>“And think of their fathers being at St. Pierre<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[255]</span>
ready to welcome them,” went on Darry. “That
makes it ten times worse.”</p>

<p>And Sam agreed that it did. The loss of their
chums cast a gloom over them impossible to dispel.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXVI<br>

<small>THE LUMBER RAFT</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Let</span> us go back and find out what really did become
of Mark and Frank at the time the <i>Vendee</i>
was struck in the darkness of the storm by the Dutch
lumber vessel.</p>

<p>As the French steamer listed to port the chums
caught at the railing before them. But this was
wet and slippery and in an instant Frank found himself
over the side.</p>

<p>“Help!” he screamed, but the cry was drowned
out in the roar of the elements around him. Mark
made a clutch at him, but he, too, was carried overboard.</p>

<p>With clasped hands the two boys struck the water
and went down and down, they knew not whither.
The accident had occurred so quickly that both were
completely bewildered, and it was purely by instinct
that each closed his mouth to keep out the briny element.
The waves leaped and foamed all around
them, and Mark felt something scrape his shoulder,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[257]</span>
he could not tell what, although long after he concluded
it must have been the side of the steamer.</p>

<p>Just what occurred during the five minutes that
followed it would be hard to describe. The boys
clung to each other, bound to live or die together.
Even in that awful moment the thought of separating
was still more terrifying. Occasionally they saw
a light, but soon these were lost to view, and they
found themselves in the blackness of the night,
alone.</p>

<p>“Frank, are you—you alive?” Such were the
first words spoken between the pair.</p>

<p>“Ye—yes,” came with a gasp. “Ho—how are
we going to get back to the—the steamer?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. I can’t see the vessel anywhere,
can you?”</p>

<p>As the waves carried them upward they gazed
around eagerly. Not a light was anywhere.</p>

<p>“The steamer has gone on—we are deserted!”
cried Mark, and his heart sank like a lump of lead
in his bosom.</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t say that,” returned Frank. “Surely,
they won’t leave us to drown!”</p>

<p>A period of silence ensued. Then Frank felt
something sheer up alongside of him. He put out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span>
a hand and felt a stick of wood—one washed overboard
from the lumber craft.</p>

<p>“A log!” he cried. “Catch hold, Mark!”</p>

<p>Mark was willing enough and they caught hold
of the log, to find that it was fastened with a short
chain to a number of other logs. Not without difficulty
they crawled to the top of the crude raft.</p>

<p>“Where did this come from?” queried Frank.
“Do you suppose they threw it overboard for us?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps, although I never saw such a life raft
on the <i>Vendee</i>—if it is a life raft. It looks more
to me like some washed-away lumber. Perhaps we
struck another ship—in fact, I am almost sure we
did. If she was a lumber craft, this must be from
her.”</p>

<p>Another spell of silence ensued, during which both
strained their eyes to see through the driving storm.
Nothing but the waves met their gaze, carrying
them upward at one moment as if to the top of a
high hill, and then letting them sink and sink into
a hollow until it looked as if they should never
rise again.</p>

<p>It was a time never to be forgotten, and each boy
breathed a silent prayer that he might be brought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[259]</span>
through this great peril in safety. Thus the minutes
slipped by, until suddenly Mark gave a cry.</p>

<p>“A light! A sky-rocket!”</p>

<p>He was right, from a great distance they saw
the rocket from the lumber vessel flare out through
the storm. Then followed a brightness lower down,
but this Bengal light was not so distinct.</p>

<p>“Can it be the steamer in distress?” they asked
each other.</p>

<p>“Looks as if something was on fire,” said Mark.
He tried to stand up on the lumber, Frank in the
meantime holding him fast by the ankles. But now
the raft went into a hollow, and when it came up
again the light was gone.</p>

<p>Slowly the hours went by and the storm gradually
subsided. The boys found that the chain was
fastened tightly around the lumber and they clung
to this and waited for daybreak. They did not mind
being wet to the skin, for the night was warm, but
each was thoroughly exhausted by his struggles.</p>

<p>At last came the light, low down in the east, and
gradually the day came over the rim of the sea—dull
and heavy and bringing little of cheer. Both stood
up and gazed around eagerly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[260]</span>Not a sail of any kind in sight.</p>

<p>It was a trying moment, and both had hard work
to command their feelings. Here they were, cast
away on the broad bosom of the Caribbean Sea,
miles from land, and with no ship to pick them up.</p>

<p>“And nothing to eat or to drink,” said Frank.
“Oh, Mark, what shall we do?”</p>

<p>“I’m sure I don’t know, Frank. All we can do
is to remain on this pile of lumber and trust to luck.”</p>

<p>“We’ll die of hunger and thirst. I’m thirsty already.”</p>

<p>“So am I, but we had better not think of that.”</p>

<p>As the day grew a little brighter they continued to
watch for the ship. Once Mark thought he saw a
vessel far to the eastward, but he was not sure. An
hour after this Frank gave a cry.</p>

<p>“Another raft, and somebody is on it!”</p>

<p>Frank was right, close at hand another raft was
floating, and on top of this lay the figure of a man,
either dead or asleep.</p>

<p>“Hullo there!” cried Mark. “Hullo! Ahoy!”</p>

<p>At first the figure on the raft did not stir, but as
the lumber came closer the man sat up and gazed
around wildly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[261]</span>On catching sight of the two boys he gave a faint
cry in a language that was strange to them.</p>

<p>“He must be a castaway like ourselves,” said
Mark.</p>

<p>“See, he is motioning to us with a rope,” said
Frank. “He is going to throw us one end.”</p>

<p>The end of the rope was thrown not once, but
three times before they could catch it. Then they
drew the other raft toward them and lashed the
two heaps of lumber together. Thus united, the
piles made a raft of considerable size.</p>

<p>The man who had thus strangely joined them was
evidently a sailor and he was suffering from an ugly
wound on the shoulder. At first he said but little,
but at last they made out that his name was Sven
Orlaff and that he was a Norwegian.</p>

<p>“I be on da Dutch boat, <i>Christiana</i>,” he said, in
broken English. “Da boat strike da steamer an’
I got by da vater in. So you go, too?”</p>

<p>“Yes, we were on the steamer,” answered Mark.
“Have you any idea where the steamer or the
Dutch boat is?”</p>

<p>At this question Sven Orlaff shook his head.
“Lose da boat—so dark,” he said. “My shouler<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[262]</span>
much hurt—I sick, fall da vater in and must swim
to da lumber. No see da boat vonce more.”</p>

<p>“We’re in a tough situation,” put in Frank, and
heaved a sigh. “Are we anywhere near to land?”</p>

<p>At this Sven Orlaff shook his head again. “No
land near dis blace,” he said. “No much boats
here.”</p>

<p>“No land and very few ships,” said Mark.
“Frank, it is certainly a dismal outlook.”</p>

<p>They saw that the Norwegian’s shoulder needed
to be bound up and went at the work without delay,
tearing the sleeves from their shirts for this purpose.
He was thankful, and told them so in his
own peculiar way.</p>

<p>The work had scarcely been accomplished when
something odd happened. Frank had allowed an
end of the rope to trail behind the raft. Now the
rope was seized by some kind of a fish who swallowed
the knot. Like a flash the Norwegian sailor pulled
in the rope, landed the fish and smashed its head
with his heel.</p>

<p>“Make to eat,” he explained. “I hungry.”</p>

<p>“Why, of course,” cried Mark. “I’m hungry
myself. I wonder if we can’t catch more of them?”</p>

<p>For answer the sailor pulled a stout fishline from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[263]</span>
his pocket, and also a knife. With the knife he cut
off a portion of the fish’s tail for bait.</p>

<p>“Give it to me, I’ll do the fishing,” said Mark,
for he did not want the hurt man to use his wounded
shoulder.</p>

<p>Luckily for them, fish were plentiful in that
vicinity, and in a moment he got a bite and landed
another fish, weighing at least two pounds. Then
he tried again and again, and soon had a mess of
a dozen.</p>

<p>“We shall not starve to death, that’s sure,” said
Frank, who had fixed a place between the lumber
for the catch. “I wish, Mark, you could catch
something else.”</p>

<p>“What’s that?”</p>

<p>“Water.”</p>

<p>“Don’t mention it. I am dry enough without
thinking about it.”</p>

<p>All were dry, and as the day wore on their thirst
increased until they could hardly endure it.</p>

<p>There was small danger of the lumber blazing up,
with so much salt water to extinguish a big fire, and
so they cut slivers from some boards and started a
little fire on the top of several big timbers, using a
match from Mark’s water-tight safe for that purpose.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[264]</span>
Soon they had a fairly good blaze going and
over this they cooked their fish, or rather, half
cooked and half burnt it, for the operation proved
far from satisfactory. But even such a meal was
better than if the fish had been raw.</p>

<p>By the time they had eaten their fill it began
to cloud up once more and soon it was raining
steadily. They lost no time in spreading their garments
to catch the water and soon each had as much
as he wished to drink. The rain lasted about two
hours, then cleared away quickly, and toward the
middle of the afternoon the sun came out.</p>

<p>As the light kept growing Mark stood up and
looked around them once more. Then he gave a
cry:</p>

<p>“A ship! A ship!”</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[265]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXVII<br>

<small>STONE DUST AND BOILING WATER</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mark’s</span> cry aroused Frank and the Norwegian
sailor, and both looked eagerly in the direction
pointed out.</p>

<p>“I see something,” said Frank, after a searching
look. “But if it is a ship or a small island I
cannot tell.”</p>

<p>“Da ship!” cried Sven Orlaff. “Da ship sure!”</p>

<p>“Do you mean your ship?” queried Mark.</p>

<p>“I no can say ’bout dat. Look lak my ship, but
no sure.”</p>

<p>For several minutes they watched the vessel in
silence. Would it come toward them?</p>

<p>“Let us raise a signal of distress,” said Frank.
“Here, I’ll put my shirt up on the end of a board.”
And this was done without delay.</p>

<p>“We mak big smoke—dat be verra goot,” suggested
Sven Orlaff, and began to kindle a blaze
where the former fire had been. Over this he
placed some wet bits of board which soon produced
so much smoke that it nearly choked them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[266]</span>“They ought to see that,” said Frank.</p>

<p>“You must remember that this raft is much
smaller than the ship, Frank,” answered Mark, who
was afraid of raising false hopes. “When we go
down into a hollow of the sea we are completely
out of their sight.”</p>

<p>An anxious quarter of an hour went by, during
which the ship seemed to come a little nearer.</p>

<p>“I believe she will come to us,” said Mark, at
last.</p>

<p>Both of the boys looked anxiously at the Norwegian
sailor, feeling that he had more experience
in such affairs than themselves.</p>

<p>Sven Orlaff shook his head sadly.</p>

<p>“Da ship go ’round—no will come here,” he said.</p>

<p>“It won’t!” gasped Mark and Frank in a breath.</p>

<p>And again the sailor shook his head. The lads
gazed eagerly, with eyes almost starting from their
sockets. Sven Orlaff was right—the distant object
was slowly but surely fading from their vision.</p>

<p>The despair of the boys was now greater than
ever, and for some time neither could trust himself
to speak.</p>

<p>“It looks as if we were doomed,” said Frank,
at last, in a choking voice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[267]</span>Mark did not answer. There seemed really nothing
to say.</p>

<p>The sun had come out strong and hot, and it was
not long before all began to feel thirsty once more.
A little water remained in the hollow between the
lumber and this they drank up, fearful that it would
otherwise evaporate.</p>

<p>Night came on slowly and now they ate another
portion of the fish. It seemed unusually dry and
they choked it down with an effort.</p>

<p>“It’s queer,” observed Frank. “This fish tastes
to me as if it was covered with fine dirt.”</p>

<p>“It must be our mouths,” replied Mark. “Mine
feels full of grit, as if I had been licking a piece
of emery paper.”</p>

<p>They looked at Sven Orlaff, and found him
rubbing his eyes. He seemed to be trying to get
something out of them.</p>

<p>“My eye, he got da dust in,” said the sailor.
“I no lak dat. Where da dust he come from annahow?”
and he rubbed his eyes again.</p>

<p>“Why, the air is full of dust!” came from
Frank, as he gazed upward. “Who ever heard of
such a thing, so far out at sea!”</p>

<p>“We must be near land,” said Mark. “Dust<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[268]</span>
couldn’t come from anywhere else. But I can’t see
any land.” And he took another look around—this
time with difficulty, for the dust appeared to
grow thicker.</p>

<p>When the sun went down it was in a curious
haze, which the Norwegian sailor said was new to
him. “Nefer see da sun lak dat,” he said. “He
look lak behine big smok.” And the boys agreed
with him.</p>

<p>“It seems to me it is growing warmer,” came
from Mark, as the darkness settled around them.
“I feel—what was that, a gun?”</p>

<p>A deep booming had reached their ears, coming
from a great distance. They listened and presently
the sound was repeated, rolling away like distant
thunder.</p>

<p>“Is that a thunder storm?” questioned Frank of
the sailor.</p>

<p>“I t’ink no sturm. I t’ink dat be da breakers.
But no can see him.”</p>

<p>They looked around for the breakers, or for some
sign of reefs, but darkness was now settled upon
every side. The booming continued at long intervals,
but they concluded that it must be miles away.</p>

<p>“I never heard of anything like it,” came from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[269]</span>
Mark. “First the dust and now this noise. It’s
certainly strange.”</p>

<p>“The raft is moving swifter, too,” returned
Frank. “I’ve noticed it for some time. There
must be some sort of a current here.”</p>

<p>Their attention was now directed to this new
discovery, and soon they noticed that the raft was
certainly moving in a direction south-east by south,
to use the nautical term. And it was going at the
rate of twenty or thirty miles an hour!</p>

<p>“The whole ocean looks different here,” said
Mark, “What do you make of it?” he asked of
Sven Orlaff.</p>

<p>The Norwegian could not explain. He said the
water had an appearance which he had never seen.
On the surface was a sort of scum which, on being
examined, proved to be, in part, of the dust they
had previously noticed.</p>

<p>“Put your hand into the water,” cried Frank.
“It is surely warmer!”</p>

<p>They did so. Frank was right, the water was
at least ten degrees hotter than it had been. Not
only this, it was growing hotter each minute, until
it got so they could scarcely put their hands into
it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[270]</span>“We are in for it now,” muttered Mark. “I
don’t know what can be the matter, but something
is surely wrong.”</p>

<p>As if to add to the peril of the situation the raft
now began to spin around and sank several feet, as
if about to go down. All clutched each other, but
soon the spinning ceased and the lumber moved onward
as before, sending the flying spray in all directions.
They had to cling fast with all their strength,
for fear of being hurled off.</p>

<p>“If we were on a river I should say we were
rushing for some cataract,” said Mark. And then
he added: “Don’t you remember, Frank, how we
went over that falls on the Orinoco?”</p>

<p>“I’ll never forget it,” answered Frank, with a
shudder. “But, unless I am mistaken, this is going
to prove a ten times worse adventure. That came
to an end in short order—there is no telling where
this will wind up.”</p>

<p>Night had now settled down fully. There was
no moon, and if the stars were shining they were
obscured by the strange dust, which now came
down as thickly as ever. They had to keep their
eyes closed for the greater part and breathed only
with difficulty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[271]</span>“If only we would strike land of some sort,”
sighed Frank. “Even a few rocks with trees would
be better than this boundless deep.”</p>

<p>“I suppose the professor and Sam and Darry
have given us up for lost,” observed Mark.</p>

<p>“Perhaps the steamer went down, Mark. She
must have been rammed fearfully by that heavy
lumber vessel. A single stick of timber is a big
battering-ram in itself.”</p>

<p>They questioned the Norwegian sailor, but he
could not tell how seriously the steamer had been
injured. “Da water come ofer me,” he said. “I
mak big fight—no t’ink of da ships. I catch da
lumber and hol’ fast. Den da ships go away and
no can see dem t’rough da sturm.”</p>

<p>It was a night long to be remembered. The hours
wore away slowly. Each took a nap in turn, while
the other two remained on guard. Sound sleeping
was out of the question, for there was no telling
what would happen next. If the truth be told, the
anxiety of the two boys was heartrending. They
would have given all they possessed, or ever hoped
to possess, to have been upon <i>terra firma</i> once more.</p>

<p>But all times must have an end, and gradually a
light in the East proclaimed the coming of another<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[272]</span>
day. The sky was still murky, but not with the
dust of the day before. Heavy clouds, not unlike
thick smoke, hung over the southern horizon, and
these gradually mounted higher and higher until
the light of the rising sun was again obscured. The
raft was moving on still, but more slowly. The
water was just as hot as ever.</p>

<p>“Do you see anything?” questioned Frank, as
Mark got up on the highest point of the lumber to
look around.</p>

<p>“I think I do,” was the slow answer. “Orlaff,
look here.”</p>

<p>The Norwegian sailor readily complied, and Frank
joined the pair.</p>

<p>“Dare is somet’ing,” said the sailor, slowly,
pointing with his arm. “I t’ink he is a boat—yes,
t’ree, four boats. And back in da cloud is a
mountain.”</p>

<p>“It must be land!” cried Mark. “Oh, I hope
it is!”</p>

<p>“But what is that big cloud?” questioned Frank.</p>

<p>“Some sort of fire, I guess,” returned Mark.
“See! see! the boats are coming this way! Oh,
Frank! we are saved!”</p>

<p>“I see more boats, Mark! Five, six, eight, ten,—there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[273]</span>
must be at least twenty of them. The
natives must be going out to fish.”</p>

<p>Wild with delight at the approach of the boats,
they yelled at the top of their lungs and waved
coats and the shirt frantically. Even Sven Orlaff
joined in the demonstration, yelling in a voice that
sounded as if it was coming through a megaphone.</p>

<p>“They see us!” cried Mark, after another painful
pause. “See, they are heading this way!”</p>

<p>“Look! look!” screamed Mark, pointing beyond
the boats. “What a fearfully black cloud! And
it is rolling this way! And listen to the thunder?
Frank, that cloud is rolling from the mountain, and
I think I can see the flashes of lightning.”</p>

<p>It was all very strange to them, and they stared in
open-mouthed wonder at the phenomenon. What
it could mean they could not surmise. Then the
raft began to whirl around and around, throwing
them down in a heap, while the air became so murky
and full of gas they could scarcely breathe. They
clutched the lumber and the chains and held fast,
and for the time being the boats in the distance
were forgotten.</p>

<small>THE ERUPTION OF MONT PELEE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">To</span> those on board of the <i>Vendee</i> the hours
dragged along dismally. Neither Sam nor Darry
knew what to do, and Professor Strong was equally
perplexed. The only person who was not deeply
affected was Hockley.</p>

<p>“It’s too bad,” he said to Sam. “But it couldn’t
be helped, and we’ve got to make the best of it.”</p>

<p>“You have never known what it is to have a
real chum, Glummy,” retorted Sam. “If you had
one, and he was taken off as Frank and Mark have
been, you wouldn’t talk in this fashion. It’s dreadful
to think they have been drowned.”</p>

<p>“Well, crying about it won’t bring ’em back,” answered
the tall youth, unfeelingly.</p>

<p>“No, it won’t, but—but I can’t get over it yet—and
perhaps I’ll never get over it,” came from
Sam, and then he turned away, unwilling to continue
the conversation with one so thoroughly unsympathetic.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[275]</span>Professor Strong walked the deck constantly.
His mind was on the missing boys and on their
fathers, whom he expected to meet at St Pierre.
What should he tell those parents when they met?
He could well imagine their deep grief. And perhaps
they would think it had been his fault that
they had been washed overboard.</p>

<p>“I should have compelled them to remain in the
cabin,” he groaned to himself. “Yes, that was my
duty, in such a storm as that! I wish they were
back—I’d give all I possess to bring them back!”
And he continued his unsatisfactory walk back and
forth, until even kind hearted Captain Danvier grew
tired of seeing the movements.</p>

<p>“You must calm yourself, my dear professor,”
he said, in French. “It is very sad, my heart goes
out to you. I know what it is. And why not?
My own brother was washed from the deck in a
storm and never seen afterward. And I had to be
captain just the same and bring my vessel to the
end of her trip. It was awful! Yes, I know how
to feel for you,” and he clapped a friendly hand on
Professor Strong’s shoulder.</p>

<p>The air was murky and hot, so much so that
even Sam and Darry noticed it. They saw the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[276]</span>
cloud of smoke at a great distance, looking at it
through a marine glass the captain loaned them.</p>

<p>“The cloud is hanging over the northern end of
the island of Martinique,” said the professor.
“There must be some sort of a forest fire raging
there.”</p>

<p>Soon somebody on deck reported that his eyes
were filled with dust. Half a dozen passengers and
sailors were affected, and the dust became so thick
that it covered everything and made it look gray.
This was a most unusual occurrence and the professor
was appealed to for an explanation.</p>

<p>“This appears to be pumice,” he said, after an
examination with a microscope. “And if it is, it
is most likely of volcanic origin. Pumice is very
light—so light that it will float on the water—which
this is doing. It is formed, so scientists say,
by the gas coming out of lava while the latter is
in a melted state.”</p>

<p>“But where does it come from?” questioned
Darry, who could not help but be interested. “Is
there any active volcano around here?”</p>

<p>“This pumice is so light that a fair wind will
carry it for many miles, Dartworth.”</p>

<p>“The wind is blowing up from the south-east,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[277]</span>
put in Sam. “Do you suppose it came from Martinique?
That big black cloud looks suspicious to
me.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps Mont Pelee has become active again!”
cried Darry. “It certainly looks so.” And he
pointed to the cloud, which looked blacker than ever.</p>

<p>“That is not impossible,” said the professor.
“You remember I told you that that volcano had
been active many times in the past. But I doubt if
the eruption will amount to anything. The volcano
is considered to be about burnt out.”</p>

<p>“Yes, it is no longer dangerous,” put in Captain
Danvier, speaking in French. “I myself was to the
top with an excursion party but two months ago.
There was a beautiful lake there and no sign of fire.
An outbreak there would amount to but little.” And
then he told how he had often discussed the volcano
with his friends at St. Pierre and Fort de France
and how all had agreed that the volcano’s activity
was of the past,—that is, so far as its capabilities
for doing much damage was concerned.</p>

<p>The dust proved so disagreeable that the professor
and the boys remained in the cabin the greater
part of the time. It was now noticed by the sailors
that the sea was running in a strange manner and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[278]</span>
that the flying spray was unusually warm. A bucket
of water was hauled up for examination and all
were astonished to learn how hot it was.</p>

<p>“Perhaps there has been an under-water eruption,”
said Professor Strong. “But that would not
account for this thick dust. It is a most remarkable
occurrence.” He was so interested that for
the moment his grief was forgotten.</p>

<p>They had been approaching the island from the
north, and now they turned due southward, to run
down the coast to the harbor of St. Pierre. Land
was still but a speck in the distance when the darkness
of night closed in on the steamer.</p>

<p>“When shall we get to St. Pierre?” asked Sam.</p>

<p>“We be dare by daylight,” answered Captain
Danvier. “Dat ees, if ze dust don’t hold us back,”
and he smiled, as if he was not very much afraid.</p>

<p>Hardly had darkness settled down when the <i>Vendee</i>
came to a sudden stop and began to drift. Inquiries
brought forth the information that the
engine had broken down, a portion of it having been
badly jarred when the steamer collided with the
Dutch lumber craft. There was no danger, and the
chief engineer said he would be able to repair the
damage long before daybreak.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[279]</span>“This will make little difference to us,” said Professor
Strong to the boys. “We will get into St.
Pierre harbor early in the morning and that will
do just as well as at night.” He spoke thus, little
dreaming of how much that delay meant to all on
board.</p>

<p>When the sun arose the <i>Vendee</i> was still at rest
on the bosom of the sea. But repairs were going
forward rapidly, and by half-past seven the engine
was once more in good running order and the
steamer resumed her course toward Martinique,
which was now plainly visible in the distance.</p>

<p>The volcanic dust had cleared away to a great
degree and over toward Mont Pelee, which arose
majestically before them, only a small black cloud
hovered.</p>

<p>“There is the smoking mountain,” said the professor.
“It doesn’t look very alarming.”</p>

<p>The <i>Vendee</i> was not making over six knots an
hour, the engineer deeming it best not to strain the
engine too greatly, so as they passed along the coast
they could see the shipping of the island and the
various industries. At one point they beheld a large
smoking ruin close to the water’s edge.</p>

<p>“That was a sugar factory—the Guerin,” said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[280]</span>
the captain, in French. “It has been burnt down.
And see, the houses around it have been burnt down
too.”</p>

<p>“The whole district is burnt down!” cried Professor
Strong. “There has been a serious calamity
of some sort here. It looks to me as if the volcano
had become active. See the wreckage drifting along
the beach.”</p>

<p>“We shall soon know,” answered the commander
of the steamer.</p>

<p>He turned to give some orders to his mate, leaving
the boys and the professor standing at the rail.
Scarcely had he disappeared when a fearful explosion
in the distance burst upon the ears of all on board.
The noise was so great that it almost stunned them.</p>

<p>“Oh, what’s that?” cried Sam.</p>

<p>“Look! look!” yelled Darry. “The volcano!”</p>

<p>“The volcano! The volcano!” came the cry from
all over the steamer. No one could say more than
that, for there was not time, nor was there need.
One look in the direction of Mont Pelee was enough
to stagger the stoutest heart.</p>

<p>The whole top of the mountain seemed to have
gone up like a discharge from a gigantic cannon.
There was a vast cloud of blackness sweeping and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[281]</span>
rolling in every direction, a blackness lit up by
patches of fire of various colors. The cloud came
on and on, growing larger and larger, until it hid
the sun and made all as dark as night. The fire
was everywhere, filling the air like rain.</p>

<p>The captain of the <i>Vendee</i> was calling to the
wheelman to turn the steamer about when a mighty
wave struck the craft, sending her staggering to
starboard. The boys held on like grim death, Hockley
shrieking in his terror. Then the vessel righted
herself, only to be heeled over again, worse than
before.</p>

<p>And now that cloud, or the extreme edge of it,
reached them and a noxious gas made them gasp
for breath. There was dust, mud and red-hot stones
in that cloud, and they fell everywhere on the deck
of the steamer as she turned to escape what looked
like certain destruction. Some of the fire landed on
the boys and the professor, and in a twinkling their
clothes were aflame.</p>

<p>“Help! help!” roared Hockley. “I am burning
up!” And then he made a dash for the cabin,
slapping out the fire as he ran. The others came
after him, putting out the flames as best they could.</p>

<p>All was confusion on board, the passengers running<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[282]</span>
hither and thither, not knowing what to do.
“The volcano is bursting!” was the cry. “We are
doomed! The sea will open and swallow us!”
Some fell upon their knees praying, others ran to the
captain imploring him to run away from the land,
while one nervous and highly excited old man leaped
into the sea, to be seen no more.</p>

<p>The sea was now foaming and boiling on all sides
of the ship. The hot stones as they fell sent up a
loud hissing and some of them cracked open with
pistol-like reports. The superheated mud was of a
sticky nature and where it fell it dried fast like so
much plaster.</p>

<p>In a few minutes the black cloud lifted somewhat,
but the patches of fire came down as thickly as ever.
The <i>Vendee</i> was set on fire in a score of places, the
masts and tarry ropes flaming up like so many
torches. She had now been turned about and was
running for the open sea at the top speed of her
engine.</p>

<p>“The ship is on fire! The ship is on fire!” Such
was the cry taken up a minute later, when it was
seen that the craft had righted and was running
steadily on her new course. “We must put out the
flames! Form a bucket brigade!” And this was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[283]</span>
done, while the captain ordered the hose brought
into use.</p>

<p>His first surprise over, Professor Strong grew
calm, and at once set to work to do all in his power
to assist in saving the <i>Vendee</i>. He found a bucket,
filled it with water and started to put out the fire
that had taken hold of a corner of the rear deck
house. Without delay Sam and Darry joined him.
Hockley remained in the cabin, wringing his hands
in despair, afraid to remain alone and equally afraid
to go outside, where the patches of fire still filled
the air.</p>

<p>“Boys, you had better keep under shelter,” panted
Professor Strong, as he worked away vigorously,
not only with the water bucket but also with a wet
swab he had discovered. “This is highly dangerous,
and——”</p>

<p>“No more so for us than for you,” interrupted
Sam. “It’s our duty to do all we can.”</p>

<p>“Creation! but this is awful!” panted Darry, as
he too began to fight the flames with another bucket.</p>

<p>“Wet your jackets—I have wet my coat,” said
the professor. “And be careful of your eyes. I
think we are getting out of the zone of fire,” he
added, as he cast an anxious eye shoreward, where<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[284]</span>
Mont Pelee was still belching forth death and destruction.</p>

<p>The two boys did as advised, and soon the three
were working like Trojans, along with some other
passengers and a number of the steamer’s crew.
The <i>Vendee</i> was now quivering from stem to stern
under her full head of steam, for the engineer had
been told of what had occurred and given to understand
that they must either get away or go down
in that awful holocaust behind them.</p>

<p>Darry and Sam had just procured fresh buckets
of water and were doing their best to put out a
patch of fire in a coil of ropes when they heard a
groan from Professor Strong, who, bucket in hand,
was staggering around clutching the air. Some hot
volcanic dust had taken the professor full in the
face, cutting off his breath.</p>

<p>“The professor is overcome!” cried Darry and
threw down his bucket on the instant. Sam did the
same, and both leaped forward just in time to save
the man from falling. The next moment Professor
Strong hung limply in their arms, his eyes closed.
Not a sound came from him, nor did he appear to
be breathing.</p>

<p>“He’s dead!” muttered Sam, hoarsely. “Oh,
Darry, this is the worst yet!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXIX<br>

<small>THE DESTRUCTION OF ST. PIERRE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">And</span> now, while Mont Pelee is in full eruption,
let us go ashore and learn what was happening in
the city of St. Pierre, with its twenty-five thousand
inhabitants and its five thousand refugees.</p>

<p>There had been more than one warning that this
terrible catastrophe was at hand. For a number of
days outbreaks of more or less importance had occurred,
which had occasioned the lava dust and the
strange condition of the water encountered so far
out at sea.</p>

<p>The first intimation that the inhabitants of northern
Martinique had that something was wrong was
on Friday, April 25, 1902. On that day curious
vapors were seen to be rising above Morne Lacroix,
the highest summit of Pelee. A number of inhabitants
went to investigate and found the water in
the lake on the mountain top boiling and throwing
off gases.</p>

<p>“We are going to have an eruption,” said some,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[286]</span>
but the majority laughed and said it would amount
to little or nothing.</p>

<p>The water in the lake continued to boil for several
days, and then the volcano began to throw up mud
and cinders, which fell on all sides of the crater.
Still there was but little alarm, until on May 2d,
when there came a shower of cinders which completely
covered some of the villages near the mountain
and even extended to certain portions of St.
Pierre.</p>

<p>The alarm was now greater, but still it was argued
that St. Pierre was safe. The leading newspaper
of St. Pierre, <i>Les Colonies</i>, gave some interesting
information about the outbreaks, and spoke about
the fine dust which had entered every house and
every store. This dust was so obnoxious that some
of the places of business had felt compelled to close
their doors. The inhabitants of the villages near
to the angry mountain were now coming into St.
Pierre for protection, and churches and many public
buildings had to be opened for their benefit. It was
reported that all vegetation around the mountain
itself had disappeared and that even the roads and
trails could no longer be found, owing to the cinders
and mud.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[287]</span>For two days cinders and mud continued to come
from the mountain and frequent explosions were
heard accompanied by slight earthquakes. The
streets of St. Pierre and other towns close to the
mountain were covered with several inches of volcanic
dust, and business came to a standstill. Many
began to leave the northern end of the island, taking
passage for Fort de France and other places further
southward. But still the majority of the citizens
of St. Pierre believed that the eruption would soon
cease, and even the governor of the island advised
them to remain by their property until the excitement
was over.</p>

<p>The River Blanche flows down from Mont Pelee
to the sea, midway between St. Pierre and the village
of Precheur on the north. Near this stream
stood the great Guerin sugar factory, with many
valuable plantations around it. On May 5th it was
noticed that the river was swelling and that its
waters were of a black and gray color. Then the
river rose with remarkable rapidity and began to
boil, and the terror-stricken people near at hand saw
that it was nothing more than a torrent of lava
and mud from the mountain sweeping down to
engulf them. On and on it came, leaping bridges<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[288]</span>
and low-lying fields, and in a few minutes not only
the buildings of the factory, but also the beautiful
villas of the owners, the houses of the workmen,
and trees and all living things were swallowed up.
The ocean went down a distance of thirty or forty
feet, leaving parts of the harbor bottom dry at
Precheur and at St. Pierre, and then arose with
tremendous force, sweeping the shipping about,
smashing small craft of all kinds, and causing a
rush of people to the hills.</p>

<p>The alarm was now universal, and several meetings
were held at St. Pierre and other places, to
decide what was best to be done. The French
war cruiser <i>Suchet</i> was called into service, to make
an examination and give all the relief possible. To
add to the horror St. Pierre was plunged into darkness
that night, the electric light plant failing to
work.</p>

<p>For two days the terror of the people continued,
and now they were leaving, or trying to leave, as
fast as they could make the necessary arrangements.
Those who owned valuable property hated, of course,
to give it up, and some said they would remain to
the end, no matter what occurred. There were constant
showers of dust, and muddy rains, and frequent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[289]</span>
rumblings as of thunder. Some parties that went
out to explore in the vicinity of the mountain reported
that all was chaos within three miles of
Pelee, and that at some points the lava and mud
lay to a depth of ten feet.</p>

<p>The next day was Thursday, May 8th. It was
Ascension Day, and early in the morning the cathedral
in St. Pierre and the churches were open for
divine service. A heavy cloud hung over Mont
Pelee, that same cloud which those on board of the
<i>Vendee</i> saw and which caused poor Frank and Mark
on their raft so much uneasiness.</p>

<p>And then the great eruption.</p>

<p>What the people of St. Pierre thought of that
fearful outburst no one can tell, for out of that
vast number, estimated at between twenty-five thousand
to thirty-one thousand people, not a single
person remained alive to tell the tale! Surely such
an awful record is enough to sadden the hardest
heart.</p>

<p>Having already viewed this scene from the deck
of the <i>Vendee</i> we know that there was scant warning
of this mighty outburst. From out of the depths
of Pelee issued mud, lava, stones, and a gigantic
volume of gas that rolled and fell directly down<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[290]</span>
upon the doomed city, cutting off every particle of
life-giving air and suffocating and burning wherever
it landed. Men, women, and children were
struck down where they stood, without being able
to do anything to save themselves. The explosions
of the gases, and the shock of an earthquake, made
hundreds of buildings totter and fall, and the rain
of fire, a thousand times thicker here than out on
the ocean, soon completed the work of annihilation.
St. Pierre, but a short time before so prosperous
and so happy, was no longer a city of the living but
had become a cemetery of the dead.</p>

<p>It was something of this last outburst that reached
Mark and Frank and the Norwegian sailor, as they
clung fast to the lumber raft as it whirled and
rocked in the boiling sea that raged on all sides of
them. Then a cloud as black as night swept over
them, so that they could scarcely see each other.</p>

<p>“What can it be?” murmured Mark. “Is it
the end of the world?”</p>

<p>“The world is on fire!” shrieked Sven Orlaff,
in his native tongue. “The Lord God have mercy
on us!” And he began to pray earnestly. The boys
did not understand him, but in the mind of each<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[291]</span>
was likewise a prayer, that God would bring them
through that terrible experience in safety.</p>

<p>At last the cloud lifted a bit and the sea became
somewhat calmer. Part of the lumber had become
loosened and drifted off, so that the raft was scarcely
half as big as before. In the excitement Mark
had had his leg severely bruised and Frank’s left
hand was much scratched and was bleeding, but
neither paid attention to the hurts.</p>

<p>“The boats—where are they?” questioned Mark,
trying to clear his eyes that he might see. All had
drifted out of sight but one, a craft with a single
sail, which the strange current had sent close beside
them. This boat was filled to overflowing with
people, Frenchmen and negroes, all as terror-stricken
as themselves.</p>

<p>“Help! Help us!” called the boys, and Sven Orlaff
added a similar appeal. But no help could be
given—the boat was already overloaded—and soon
wind and current carried her out of sight through
the smoke and dust and the rolling sea.</p>

<p>Slowly the hours passed and gradually the sky
cleared, although over Mont Pelee still hung that
threatening cloud of death. The sea remained hot,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[292]</span>
and as the lumber raft drifted southward it encountered
numerous heaps of wreckage. Far off
could be seen the ruins of buildings which still
smoked and occasionally blazed up.</p>

<p>“It’s a tremendous volcanic explosion,” said
Mark, at last. “I believe Mont Pelee has blown
its head off.”</p>

<p>“Look! Look!” cried Sven Orlaff. “Da boat!
We git da boat!”</p>

<p>He pointed but a short distance away. A boat
was drifting toward them, a craft probably twenty-five
feet in length and correspondingly broad of
beam. The boat had had a mast but this was broken
off short and hung, with the sail, over the side.</p>

<p>Soon the boat bumped up against the lumber raft
and they caught hold of the wreckage and held fast.
The body of the craft was in good condition and
they immediately leaped into the boat and began
to clear away the fallen mast and the sail with its
ropes. There were some signs of fire both at the
bow and the stern but this had done little but char
the seats and gunwale. In the bottom of the boat
rested a keg and several boxes.</p>

<p>“This is much better than the lumber,” observed
Frank, when they were safely on board and had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[293]</span>
saved part of the mast and the sail. “I suppose
this boat either went adrift or the persons in her
were drowned. What do you suppose is in the
keg and in the boxes?”</p>

<p>“Water in da keg,” announced the sailor, after
an examination. He took a long drink and the boys
did the same. The water was very warm but to
their parched throats it was like nectar.</p>

<p>On breaking open the boxes they were found to
contain eatables of various kinds, evidently packed
for a trip of several days. At once all fell to, eating
the first “square” meal they had had since
drifting around.</p>

<p>“There, that puts new life into a fellow,” exclaimed
Mark, when he had finished. “Now let
us hoist that mast and sail and steer for St. Pierre.”</p>

<p>“Do you believe this eruption reached that city?”
questioned Frank, with a look of new alarm suddenly
showing itself on his worn face.</p>

<p>Mark gazed back blankly for an instant. “Great
Cæsar, Frank! If it did, and your father and mine
were there——” Mark could not finish.</p>

<p>With sober faces the two boys assisted Sven Orlaff
to hoist the broken mast and fix it in place
with ropes, of which, fortunately there were plenty,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[294]</span>
they having been dragging in the water, thus escaping
the fire. Then the sail was hoisted, and they
began a slow journey southward, in the direction of
St. Pierre harbor.</p>

<p>As the boat advanced more wreckage was encountered,
and once they passed a small raft filled
with household goods. On top of the goods lay
the half burnt bodies of several people. Then they
passed the bodies of several cows and of a horse,
and the wreckage became thicker and thicker. The
sights made them shudder and grow sick at heart.</p>

<p>Night found them still on the sea, some distance
west of St. Pierre, for they had missed their reckoning
by over a mile, Sven Orlaff being but a common
sailor and understanding little more of steering than
themselves. A horrible smell reached them, coming
from the distant shore.</p>

<p>When day dawned, it found them somewhat
rested and eager to get closer to land, although they
determined not to go ashore until they felt it would
be safe to do so. Each of the boys was thinking
of his father. Was it possible that St. Pierre had
been overcome and were their parents dead?</p>

<p>As last they made out the distant city, and the
harbor dotted here and there with the burnt shipping.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[295]</span>
Directly in the roadstead rested the wrecked and
burnt hulk of a big steamship, the <i>Roraima</i>, of the
Quebec line. The <i>Roraima</i> had been caught with
twenty-one passengers and a crew of forty-seven on
board, and of that number less than a third were
saved and many of these were horribly crippled for
life.</p>

<p>“Another ship! A man-of-war!” cried Frank,
and he was right. Close at hand was the big warship,
the <i>Suchet</i>, sent north once more from Fort
de France to investigate the happenings of St.
Pierre. The captain of the warship had just taken
on board the survivors from the <i>Roraima</i>, and now
a hail was sent to our friends and they too were
assisted to the deck.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXX<br>

<small>LOOKING FOR THE MISSING ONES</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Oh</span>, Mark, the city is laid in ashes! Nobody
escaped!”</p>

<p>It was Frank who uttered the words, after a
French naval officer, who could speak English, had
explained the situation.</p>

<p>“But some people must have gotten away,” insisted
Mark, unwilling to believe the awful facts.
“Remember how we found our boat, and how we
saw those other boats further up the coast. They
must have had warning enough.”</p>

<p>“But the fiery blast came so quickly,” went on
the younger youth. “Those from the <i>Roraima</i> say
it came in one gigantic swoop that swept everything
before it. If that is so, and our fathers were in
the city——”</p>

<p>“We must go ashore and make a search, Frank—that
is, as soon as it is safe to do so. I wonder
where the <i>Vendee</i> is?”</p>

<p>“There is no telling. If she was in the harbor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[297]</span>
perhaps she was burnt up like the <i>Roraima</i> and those
other craft lying about,” answered Frank, dismally.</p>

<p>It was truly a trying time on board of the warship,
where the cries of those suffering from burns
could be plainly heard. The boys wanted to help,
but were told there were plenty of doctors for that
purpose. In the meantime Sven Orlaff had made
himself at home among the sailors.</p>

<p>Two hours later found the lads on shore, in company
with a searching party sent to bring in any
persons who might be found alive. The landing
was made in a small boat some distance south of the
fallen city. There were two priests and several
naval officers, and also half a dozen Frenchmen, and
two Americans who had business interests in that
locality.</p>

<p>It was with extreme difficulty that the boys picked
their way along, over the trunks of fallen trees and
over rocks which were still hot to the touch. Everything
was blasted as if by a lightning stroke and covered
with mud, lava and ashes. Nothing could be
seen of the roadway, which was buried beneath
stones, brick and other debris.</p>

<p>The boys had been told in their letters that their
parents would stop at the Hotel Rosa, on the Rue de<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[298]</span>
Victor Hugo, one of the principal streets of St.
Pierre. One of the Americans in the party, John
Waterbury by name, was bound for this street, and
the boys plodded along beside him.</p>

<p>It took them two hours to gain the neighborhood,
so great were the ruins on all sides. Dead bodies
were everywhere in evidence, some buried under
tons and tons of fallen stones and bricks. Even the
great cathedral and the massive bank buildings had
not escaped. At last John Waterbury came to a halt
and heaved a deep sigh.</p>

<p>“As I thought,” he said. “Do you see yonder
pile of smoking ruins? That was where our three-storied
business building stood, with a stock of
goods worth thirty thousand dollars. It is gone—every
dollar of it—and my two partners and our
four clerks have probably lost their lives also.”</p>

<p>“It is awful!” murmured Mark. He could
scarcely speak. “Simply awful! And where was
the—the Hotel Rosa?” he faltered.</p>

<p>“That building over yonder. I can tell it only by
that twisted iron railing of the balcony. I have sat
on that balcony many a time with my feet on the
railing. It doesn’t seem to be destroyed as utterly as
our building, but it is pretty well riddled.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[299]</span>And riddled it was, from top to bottom, with the
back and one side wall completely demolished. In
the street the wreckage lay five or six feet deep, and
over all was the mud and lava dust, still hot. The
boys’ feet were uncomfortably warm and looking
at their shoes they found that the soles were seared
as by a hot iron.</p>

<p>There was no sign of life about the hotel. In one
of the windows hung the half doubled up body of a
man, burnt beyond all possible recognition. As the
lads gazed at it a shiver passed over them impossible
to suppress. Could that be—but no, it was too horrible—they
would not believe it.</p>

<p>“Let us go!” whispered Frank, hoarsely. “I—I
can’t stand it!” And he swayed as if about to
faint.</p>

<p>Mark caught his chum by the arm, and both
picked their way to where they had left John Waterbury.
Nothing could be accomplished while the
ruins were so hot, and the American business men
accompanied them back to the shore below St.
Pierre. Here they learned that the warship had
sailed to another quarter of the island, but a relief
boat named the <i>Ridalla</i> was at hand, and they were
taken on board this craft and made to feel at home.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[300]</span>From those on board of the <i>Ridalla</i>, Mark and
Frank learned that the <i>Vendee</i> had been spoken several
hours before, and that the steamer was now
heading back to Martinique. She had suffered, as
we already know, but nothing had been lost but a
number of ropes and a corner of the cabin, which
were burnt away.</p>

<p>“I’m glad they are safe,” said Mark. “The
<i>Vendee</i> might have suffered like the <i>Roraima</i> and
those other ships.”</p>

<p>An hour later a lookout announced the appearance
of the <i>Vendee</i>, and not long after this the
steamer came into the harbor and dropped anchor.
At once Mark and Frank begged to be taken on
board and their wish was speedily granted.</p>

<p>“Mark! Frank!” The cry came from Darry,
who chanced to be on deck, and the next moment
the lad was fairly hugging the pair. “Well of all
that is wonderful! We had given you both up as
lost!”</p>

<p>“We’ve had a hard time of it,” answered Mark.
“How did you make out?”</p>

<p>“Oh, we caught our share too, I can tell you that.
The fire rained all over the ship and we had to fight
it like mad for over an hour. The professor was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[301]</span>
overcome and Sam and I were afraid he was dead.
But he got over it after a while, and now he is as
well as ever. I suppose St. Pierre is a sight. But
tell me how you escaped being drowned. But no,
come into the cabin first and see the others.”</p>

<p>Darry led the way, and soon they ran into all the
others of the party. There was another joyous
greeting, in which even Hockley had the good sense
to join. Then each party had to tell its story, to
which the other listened with breathless attention.</p>

<p>“You were more than fortunate,” said Professor
Strong, after Mark and Frank had finished. “Getting
aboard that lumber raft, and later on the small
boat, was certainly providential. And we were
equally fortunate in being delayed by the breaking
down of the engine. Had it not been for that the
<i>Vendee</i> would surely be lying a wreck in St. Pierre
harbor.”</p>

<p>Captain Danvier was glad to see the boys, and
from them learned the particulars concerning the
lumber vessel that had been struck.</p>

<p>“They will not prosecute me at law,” he said to
Professor Strong, in French. “They knew the collision
was as much their fault as mine.” And so it
proved. Later on the Dutch owners of the lumber<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[302]</span>
boat sent several threatening communications, and
Captain Danvier answered in an equally threatening
manner; and there the matter rested. It may be as
well to add that Sven Orlaff never went back to the
lumber boat, but enlisted instead in the service of a
packet line running from the West Indies to Brazil.</p>

<p>Word soon came for Captain Danvier to take his
vessel to Fort de France, and he sailed to that port
with our friends on board. Sam and Darry had
wanted to go ashore to inspect the ruins but Hockley
had objected strongly.</p>

<p>“I don’t want to run any more risks,” said the tall
youth. “I want to get just as far away from that
volcano as possible.”</p>

<p>They found Fort de France a busy place. It was
fast filling up with refugees from all parts of Martinique,
and many public buildings had been thrown
open for the accommodation of the newcomers.
More than this, relief was already pouring in from
many places, including the United States, where the
news of the terrible catastrophe had shocked the
whole nation.</p>

<p>Professor Strong would have been willing to
leave the West Indies without delay, but Frank and
Mark stoutly objected to going before they had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[303]</span>
learned something concerning their fathers, and he
did not care to sail without them.</p>

<p>“I’m going to make a systematic search,” said
Mark to Frank, after several days had been spent in
Fort de France. “It is possible that your father and
mine came down here from St. Pierre.” And he and
Frank did make a search which lasted forty-eight
hours.</p>

<p>It was then that they ran across a Frenchman who
was in the business of exporting dyewoods. The
Frenchman had met Mr. Robertson and Mr. Newton
twice, and transacted some business with both.</p>

<p>“They were up at St. Pierre three days before
the great eruption,” said the dyewoods exporter,
who could speak good English. “They told me that
they were going to make a journey overland to Basse
Pointe, on the north coast. Whether they started
before St. Pierre fell, or whether they were caught
on the way, I cannot tell.”</p>

<p>This conversation filled Mark and Frank with renewed
hope that their parents might have escaped,
and they talked the matter over with Professor
Strong and Sam and Darry.</p>

<p>“Basse Pointe is a small town lying almost directly
north of Mont Pelee,” said the professor. “It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[304]</span>
is just as close to the volcano as St. Pierre and has
suffered a good deal, so they say, although not as
much as the city.”</p>

<p>“But couldn’t we go up there in some kind of a
boat, or overland?” questioned Mark, eagerly.
“Perhaps my father and Frank’s are up there?”</p>

<p>The professor said he would make inquiries, and
set about doing so without delay. He could find no
boat running to Basse Pointe, but there was a native
craft about to sail for St. Marie, a village about ten
miles below the point they wished to gain.</p>

<p>“Then I’m going to St. Marie and travel overland
to Basse Pointe,” said Mark, and Frank said the
same.</p>

<p>“And I’ll go with you,” put in Sam.</p>

<p>“Ditto myself,” chimed in Darry. “I want to see
something of this volcanic eruption before I leave
Martinique.”</p>

<p>“Well, you fellows can go,” came from Hockley.
“But you won’t budge me. If there comes another
downpour of lava, rocks and mud you’ll all be
killed.”</p>

<p>Darry was about to say something about a coward,
when Mark stopped him. “We don’t want<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[305]</span>
Hockley anyway,” he whispered. “And it is just as
dangerous as he says.”</p>

<p>Another talk followed, and it was hard work for
the boys to get Professor Strong to consent to the
plan. But the professor was secretly as eager as any
of them, for he knew that the scientific magazines
would welcome an article from his pen describing
the condition of this territory immediately after the
great eruption.</p>

<p>“I cannot blame Mark and Frank for wanting to
go,” he said. “But as to you, Samuel, and Dartworth——”</p>

<p>“Oh, you must consent!” interrupted Darry.
“What are we journeying around for if not to see
the sights? And this is such a sight as comes only
once in a lifetime.” So it was settled; and that evening
found the five on the ship bound for St. Marie.
Hockley was left at a hotel in Fort de France to
await their return.</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[306]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXXI<br>

<small>DANGEROUS VOLCANO EXPLORING</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> journey to St. Marie was made without
special incident, and thirty-six hours later the party
landed in the little village, to find it all but deserted.
Many of the inhabitants had fled in boats and others
had journeyed overland to Fort de France.</p>

<p>On landing, the boys and the professor lost no
time in making inquiries concerning the road to
Basse Pointe. They were told that it ran along the
shore, past Grand Anse, another village, also deserted.
There were a number of bridges to cross,
and whether these were in good condition nobody
could tell.</p>

<p>“This is getting more risky,” observed the professor,
but at that moment a black man came up
who could speak English, and he offered to guide
them to any point they wished to go providing they
would pay him a sum equal to five dollars per day,—this
amount being a small fortune to the fellow.</p>

<p>“We’ll take you up, Gambo,” said the professor.
“Let us start at once.” And they set off, each carrying<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[307]</span>
some food with him, for there was no telling
what desolation lay in store for them.</p>

<p>Gambo was a bright, intelligent fellow, and under
his guidance they made rapid progress. By nightfall
they reached Grand Anse, to find it covered with
volcanic dust and stones. Only four natives had
remained there, and they said they were going to
depart as soon as a certain boat came back for them.
They asked Gambo about the Americans, and then
said they had seen some other Americans up in the
mountains, the day before the awful eruption.</p>

<p>“They must have been Mark’s father and mine!”
cried Frank, excitedly. “Ask them where they
went to?”</p>

<p>Gambo did so. The reply was uncertain. The
Americans had been at a small settlement called Frodamalos
but where they had gone after that was not
known.</p>

<p>“Where is Frodamalos?” questioned Professor
Strong.</p>

<p>“Up the mountainside,” answered Gambo. “It
is close to Pelee.”</p>

<p>“I don’t care—I’m going anyway,” said Frank.
“I don’t believe we are going to have any more
eruptions—at least, not right away.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[308]</span>Again there was a conference, but in the end the
professor yielded, and they went forward towards
the interior of Martinique. The lofty height of
Mont Pelee was before them, still crowned with
black smoke and many-colored vapor. The mighty
giant was resting, preparatory to a greater exhibition
of strength.</p>

<p>The evidences of the fearful eruption were more
and more pronounced as they advanced. Down near
the shore the vegetation had been only dust covered,
here it was literally burnt up. The trees were stripped
bare, leaving only the black trunks standing.
The ground was cracked in a thousand places, while
here and there were large deposits of mud and lava,
twisted and turned into all sorts of curious shapes.
Occasionally they passed the bones of some animal,
and in one spot they came upon the partly consumed
bodies of two natives who had died locked in each
other’s arms. At the sight of the dead natives
Gambo fell upon his knees in horror. Then of a
sudden he leaped up, turned, and fled in the direction
from whence he had come, running as if a legion
of demons were at his heels.</p>

<p>“He has deserted us,” said the professor, after
calling for the negro to come back. “Even the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[309]</span>
offer of five dollars per day in gold couldn’t hold him
after such a sight.”</p>

<p>“But I am not going to turn back,” said Mark,
with set teeth, and he strode on, with Frank beside
him; and the others followed.</p>

<p>It was hard walking and climbing, and frequently
they had to pause to get their breath. The air
seemed to grow more suffocating as they drew
nearer to the volcano.</p>

<p>“It is the gas,” said Professor Strong. “I think
we had better go back.” And he shook his head
doubtfully.</p>

<p>“There are the ruins of a village!” exclaimed
Sam, pointing to a hill on their left. “That must
be Frodamalos.”</p>

<p>Without replying Mark led the way toward the
spot pointed out. They had to cross a bed of lava
and mud that was still warm, and then leap a wide
ravine before they could get close to the wreckage
of huts and houses.</p>

<p>“Not a person in sight, nor a dead body,” remarked
Frank, as they gazed about them. “That
looks encouraging. Everybody here evidently got
out before the big explosion.”</p>

<p>“Let us go a little closer to the volcano, now we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[310]</span>
are here,” suggested Sam. “I don’t believe there
is any immediate danger of another outburst.”</p>

<p>The sight of the lofty mountain, with its smoke
and vapor, was a fascinating one, and cautiously
they moved forward once more until they could see
the openings and the streams of lava quite plainly.
The top of the mountain appeared to be split into
several sections, and at one point they could see a
ruddy glow that betokened a vast fire beneath.</p>

<p>“Come, let us go back,” said Professor Strong,
decidedly. “This is far too dangerous. We have
seen enough.” And he caught Mark and Frank by
the arm.</p>

<p>“Look! look!” cried Darry, pointing with his
hand. “The fire is growing brighter!”</p>

<p>“And the lava is beginning to flow again!”
ejaculated Sam. “You are right, professor, we had
best get away from here!”</p>

<p>All looked back and saw that Sam was right. The
lava was beginning to flow from two of the vents
in the mountain top. It was a steaming, hissing
and dangerous looking mass, and began to move
down on both sides of them.</p>

<p>“We must run for it!” exclaimed Professor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[311]</span>
Strong. “If we do not that lava may cut off our
retreat. Come!” And he set off, with all of the
boys around him.</p>

<p>It was no easier to descend the mountainside
than it had been to come up. Rocks and loose stones
were numerous, and it appeared to them that some
of the cracks in the surface were wider than before.
Once Darry stumbled and fell, and the wind was
knocked out of him so completely that the others had
to help him up and hold him for a moment. Then
they turned in the wrong direction and encountered
a bed of half-dried mud into which they sunk up to
their shoe tops.</p>

<p>“Hi! this won’t do!” called out Sam, who was
in the lead. “We’ll all be stuck like flies on flypaper.
We’ll have to go to the right.” And this
they did.</p>

<p>Looking back they saw that the lava was now
flowing at a greater rate than ever. It hissed and
steamed viciously, as if anxious to overtake them.
The main flow on their right had divided into two
streams and one of these was coming straight for
them!</p>

<p>“We must get to the other side of yonder split<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[312]</span>
in the rocks!” cried Professor Strong. “It’s our
only hope. Come, boys!” And he urged them before
him.</p>

<p>The crevasse he mentioned was a good fifty yards
away, and now the lava was approaching with incredible
swiftness, like some fiery serpent bent upon
their destruction. On and on they sped, until their
breath came thick and fast and poor Frank felt on
the point of fainting away. The professor caught
him by the shoulder and almost dragged him to the
edge of the opening.</p>

<p>With the lava at their very heels the boys and
Professor Strong made the leap over the wide crevasse.
The professor had Frank by the hand and went
over in safety with his charge, and the leaps of
Mark and Darry were equally successful. But poor
Sam, as he started to jump, slipped and fell.</p>

<p>“Help!” cried Sam, and then half fell across the
opening, to clutch at the edge of the crevasse with
his hands. There was next to nothing to hold to,
and he was on the point of dropping out of sight
when Mark made a dive for him, followed by Darry.
Each caught a wrist in his grasp and pulled with all
of his strength, and in a moment more Sam was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[313]</span>
safe. But the escape had been a narrow one, and the
youth was as pale as a sheet.</p>

<p>As the whole party collected on the opposite side
of the opening the lava poured into it with an increased
hissing and a rapid rising of steam. Then,
as the lava struck some water far below, there was a
loud report, followed by others.</p>

<p>“Come, we have no time to waste!” went on the
professor. “That opening will soon fill up and then
the lava will be after us again. We must get down
to the ocean without delay.”</p>

<p>Again they went on, this time in an irregular
line, each holding on to the others. Frank had a
stitch in the side, and so had Darry, but neither
dared to complain. They knew it was a run for life.</p>

<p>At last they came in sight of the sea, far below
them, for they had come out on something of a cliff.
There was a rough path leading downward, and over
this they stumbled, they could scarcely tell how,
afterward. Then they ran out along a broad beach.
They saw a boat not far away and called loudly to
those on board.</p>

<p>At first the craft refused to come in for them. It
was a small affair, manned by two Frenchmen. But<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[314]</span>
Professor Strong promised the sailors a big reward
for their assistance, and presently our friends were
taken aboard.</p>

<p>“That ends volcano exploring for me,” gasped
Sam, when they were safe on board. “That was a
close shave.”</p>

<p>“It certainly was,” came from Darry. “It was
only that split in the earth that saved us from that
stream of lava.”</p>

<p>Neither Mark nor Frank said anything. The exploration,
so far as finding out anything about their
parents was concerned, had been a failure.</p>

<p>The French sailors were bound for St. Pierre by
way of the north passage around the island, and
there was nothing to do but to remain on board until
the capital city was reached. It was now seen that
Mont Pelee was getting ready for another eruption.</p>

<p>This outburst, four-fold greater than those already
described, occurred the next day, while the
small craft was well away from the shore. The
thunder and lightning from the volcano were something
stupefying, and tremendous masses of rocks
and lava were hurled forth, to lay the whole northern
end of Martinique in complete desolation. The ruins
of St. Pierre were all but buried from sight, and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[315]</span>
force of the eruption was felt even as far south as
Fort de France, where much dust and not a few
stones fell, to add to the terror of a population already
on the verge of despair.</p>

<p>It may be as well to add here that Martinique
was at these trying times not the only island in that
vicinity to suffer from volcanic action. On St. Vincent,
a British possession one hundred miles further
south, the volcano called La Soufriere went into
equal activity, and an eruption at Mont Pelee was
usually attended by a similar happening at the other
volcano, showing that the two were most likely in
some way connected. The activity of La Soufriere
threw the natives of St. Vincent into a panic, and
although but few people, comparatively, were killed,
yet they flocked to Kingstown, the capital, and many
begged the government to aid them in getting away.
It was a time of great anxiety in all the Lesser Antilles
and many predicted that all these islands, which
as already mentioned, are in reality nothing but the
tops of a long range of mountains, would either
blow up or sink into the sea.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXXII<br>

<small>THE FATE OF CAPTAIN SUDLIP</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">By</span> the time the small native craft reached the vicinity
of St. Pierre the great eruption was at an end,
and Pelee had once more resumed its normal condition,
saving for the cloud of black smoke and the
strange vapor still clinging to its lofty top. Even
from a great distance, however, it could be noticed
that the top of the grand old mountain was split into
several parts.</p>

<p>In the harbor of St. Pierre were collected a dozen
or more steamers sent from various ports to give aid
to the sufferers who were flocking in from many
of the outlying districts. Provisions were to be had
in plenty, and also clothing, while a score or more of
surgeons and physicians stood ready to care for the
sick, the wounded and the dying.</p>

<p>“What an awful scene of desolation!” remarked
Sam, as they gazed at the distant ruin of the once
prosperous city. “Everything seems to be buried
under the fall of lava and mud.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">[317]</span>“Yes, and the lava has turned to stone,” added
Mark. “I don’t believe they will ever rebuild this
place.”</p>

<p>“It is not likely,” said Professor Strong. “Or,
if they do, it will not be for many years. In my
opinion the whole north end of Martinique will be
abandoned, for there is no telling how soon Mont
Pelee will belch forth again.”</p>

<p>It was not long after this that they passed the
wreckage of a French sailing vessel which had been
burnt near to the north shore of St. Pierre. Another
boat was at hand, transferring such of the cargo
as remained undamaged.</p>

<p>“I wonder what craft that is?” said Frank. “It
looks something like a boat we saw in the harbor of
Havana.”</p>

<p>“She is from Havana,” said a Frenchman, who
was at hand, working. “The <i>Raven</i>, Captain
Sudlip.”</p>

<p>“Captain Sudlip!” came from several of the boys.</p>

<p>“Was his full name Jason Sudlip?” questioned
Professor Strong, with equal interest.</p>

<p>“Yes. Then you knew him?”</p>

<p>“We did. But we didn’t know he was captain of
a schooner like this.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">[318]</span>“It was a new command for him. At the last
moment the regular captain of the <i>Raven</i> was taken
sick and Captain Sudlip took his place. Poor fellow,
it was a fatal trip for him.”</p>

<p>“Is Captain Sudlip dead?” questioned Darry.</p>

<p>“Not dead, but horribly burnt. They have taken
him to the hospital at Roseau, on the island of Dominica,
but the doctors say he cannot live.”</p>

<p>The Frenchman resumed his work, and the craft
containing our friends moved off down the coast.
For some minutes nobody spoke. Then Darry
heaved a long sigh.</p>

<p>“It’s horrible!” he murmured. “Horrible!
Captain Sudlip wasn’t our friend, but I pity him.”</p>

<p>“And so do I pity him,” put in Sam. “I trust
his case isn’t as bad as reported.”</p>

<p>This was all that was said, but nobody forgot the
matter until a long time after. It may be as well
to state here that the captain was in a very bad way
and that he died inside of the week.</p>

<p>It was utterly impossible to think of going ashore
at St. Pierre, and fearful of another eruption which
might cost them their lives, Professor Strong procured
passage on a little ferry steamer which had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">[319]</span>
formerly run regularly between the fallen city and
Fort de France.</p>

<p>Turning southward again made the hearts of
Mark and Frank sink like lead within their bosoms.
Their thoughts were constantly on their parents.</p>

<p>“I can’t give my father up—I simply can’t!” said
Frank to his chum, in a choking voice. “It’s too
awful to think of!”</p>

<p>“I feel exactly the same, Frank,” answered the
older youth. “But what more can we do?”</p>

<p>“I am going to make more inquiries when we
reach Fort de France.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I shall do that, too.”</p>

<p>On the way down the coast they fell in with many
vessels, all going to St. Pierre to give aid to those
who, alas, were beyond human needs. These craft
moved along silently, nobody feeling in the humor
to even discuss the situation.</p>

<p>As soon as they landed at the capital city they
started for the post-office, to learn if anything in the
shape of a letter had been left for one or another of
the party. They found the streets crowded with
people of all nationalities and for the first time
learned how Fort de France had received a shower<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">[320]</span>
of dust and stones, and how everybody had been
terrorized and business brought to a standstill.</p>

<p>“It’s a fearful state of affairs,” said Sam. “They
won’t recover from this for years.”</p>

<p>“St. Pierre will never recover, Samuel,” returned
the professor. “The eruption has——”</p>

<p>Professor Strong stopped short, for a cry from
Mark had interrupted him. The youth was pointing
up a street to their left.</p>

<p>“See! see! There is a crowd of negroes and they
are beating a white man! If somebody don’t help
the white fellow they will kill him!”</p>

<p>They started forward, and were soon on the edge
of the crowd which numbered fully a dozen colored
men. In the very midst was the white man Mark
had mentioned. His hat was off, his collar and tie
loose, his shirt torn, and he was fighting desperately.
One cheek was bleeding from a long cut and his left
arm hung limply at his side.</p>

<p>“It is Dan Markel!” ejaculated Darry. “Dan
Markel, the fellow who once swindled Hockley!”</p>

<p>The crowd around the man was yelling fiercely
and striking at every available opportunity. Dan
Markel was yelling in return, but nobody appeared
to listen to him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">[321]</span>“We must do something, or he’ll surely be killed,”
said Frank.</p>

<p>By this time Professor Strong was close to the
crowd. “Stop!” he called out, in French. “Stop!
What does this mean?”</p>

<p>“He is a rascal!” said one native, wrathfully.
“He is not fit to live!”</p>

<p>“He robbed the dead,” said another. “We saw
him doing it—up at the Ladarosa plantation.”</p>

<p>“Let me go!” screamed Markel, in English.
“It’s all a mistake.”</p>

<p>By this time the crowd was growing larger, and
the shouting continued, until to make out what one
individual was saying was impossible. Those
nearest to Markel continued to strike at the man
from Baltimore, until he went down from a blow
on the head, and several in the crowd fell on top of
him.</p>

<p>It was at this critical moment that several gens-d’armes
appeared. They were doing police duty in
that neighborhood, and at once set to work to restore
peace. But it was not without great difficulty
that they succeeded in quieting the negroes, who insisted
upon it that Dan Markel be arrested.</p>

<p>“He is a looter—a robber of the dead,” said one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">[322]</span>
of the natives. And then he explained that he was
an assistant foreman on the Ladarosa plantation not
far from St. Pierre. The master of the plantation
had been killed, along with several others of the
household, while the negroes had fled to a rocky
cave for safety. On returning to the house two days
after the first eruption they had found Dan Markel
there and in the act of stealing the silverware and
jewelry. Markel had escaped them but they remembered
his face well.</p>

<p>The man from Baltimore tried to deny this story,
saying he had reached Fort de France from La
Guayra that morning, but on being searched some
jewelry which the negroes identified was found in his
pockets. He was at once marched off to the local
jail, there to await trial, the natives following the
gens-d’armes to see that the prisoner did not get
away.</p>

<p>“It will go hard with Markel,” said Darry.
“Robbery under such circumstances becomes a
double crime.”</p>

<p>“In some countries such looters would be hung,”
answered Professor Strong. “You may depend
upon it that Markel will get the full penalty of the
law.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">[323]</span>“This will please Hockley,” came from Sam.
“He was always sorry the rascal got away. I wonder
if Hockley is still up at the hotel?” he continued.</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t be surprised if he got out of Fort de
France when that shower of dust and stones came,”
returned Mark. “He was scared to death as it
was.”</p>

<p>A short while later found them at the post-office
asking for letters. Owing to the general disorder
it was half an hour before any mail was handed
out.</p>

<p>The first communication proved to be from Hockley,
and was addressed to Professor Strong. It was
short, and had evidently been written while the
youth was in an excited frame of mind. It ran as
follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Professor</span>: It looks now as if this island
was doomed and I don’t propose to be burnt up or be
drowned. There is a steamer sailing from here to
Port-of-Spain, Trinidad, and other ports in South
America, and I have secured passage. If I stop off
at Port-of-Spain you can look for me at the hotel
at which we stopped before, and if I go further I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">[324]</span>
will leave word in a letter at the post-office. Have
cabled my father to send necessary money.”</p>
</div>

<p>“I knew Hockley wouldn’t stay,” said Darry.
“I’ll wager he was almost paralyzed with terror.”
And he was right. Hockley had acted so thoroughly
scared that he had made himself the laughing stock
of all, both at the hotel and on board the steamer
on which he had secured passage. It was to be some
time before they would see their tall traveling companion
again.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXXIII<br>

<small>A HAPPY MEETING—CONCLUSION</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> letter from Hockley read, they waited
patiently until some mail matter which had just
come in should be sorted out. This took the best
part of an hour—a wait which to Mark and Frank
seemed an age.</p>

<p>But at last the little window was opened once
more and the crowd surged forward. Professor
Strong was well to the front and presently they saw
him turn from the window with half a dozen communications
held aloft.</p>

<p>“Letters!” cried Frank. “Oh, if only they
bring good news!”</p>

<p>The professor was soon beside them. There were
letters for all, but just then the interest was concentrated
on a communication addressed to Mark and
another addressed to Frank. Both bore the postmark
of Kingstown, St. Vincent.</p>

<p>“My father’s handwriting!” cried Mark, in a
trembling voice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">[326]</span>“And this is in my father’s hand!” came from
Frank, falteringly. His hand shook so he could not
open the envelope. “Yo—you read it, professor.”</p>

<p>Professor Strong did so. The communication
had been written the day before and ran in this wise:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
“<span class="smcap">My dear son Frank</span>:<br>
</p>

<p>“I am writing this in the hope that you are safe
despite the fearful volcano eruptions which have
taken place in this quarter of the globe. I know
you were bound for St. Pierre, but I have learned
that by the goodness of an all-wise Providence the
<i>Vendee</i> escaped the eruption that destroyed St.
Pierre and all the shipping in that harbor.</p>

<p>“Mr. Robertson and myself have had a narrow
escape from death, and we do not yet know if we
are entirely safe, for the volcano on this island is
now as active as that on Martinique. We were
within four miles of Mont Pelee when the eruption
of May 8th occurred. We escaped by what was
little short of a miracle, and were lucky enough to
get on a trading vessel bound for this port. I had
my lower limbs and feet considerably burnt, and
Mr. Robertson suffered from burns on his feet and
on his left arm. But none of the burns are serious,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">[327]</span>
and we are resting here quite comfortably. If we
were well enough we would set out in search of you,
but as it is neither of us can do any walking at
present.</p>

<p>“I am sending this letter in duplicate to half a
dozen ports in this territory, and Mr. Robertson is
sending similar letters addressed to Mark. As soon
as you receive a letter let me hear from you, as
both of us are anxious for news. And also send
word home if you are safe. Address me at the
Windsor Hotel, Kingstown, Island of St. Vincent.”</p>
</div>

<p>“Oh, how glad I am that they are safe!” murmured
Frank, and then he looked at Mark, who had
been reading his own letter. There were tears in
the eyes of both and that look meant more than any
words of mine can tell.</p>

<p>“I must go to Kingstown at once,” said Mark.
“I can’t be satisfied until I see for myself just how
they are faring.”</p>

<p>“And I will go with you,” answered Frank.
“Perhaps the burns are worse than we imagine. I
know father. He wouldn’t want to worry me.”</p>

<p>The matter was talked over by all, and in the end
Professor Strong agreed to see about passage to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">[328]</span>
St. Vincent. Darry and Sam wanted to keep with
Frank and Mark, and the whole party sailed southward
the next morning at sunrise.</p>

<p>The run to St. Vincent, past the Island of St.
Lucia, which, strange to say, had entirely escaped
the eruptions on both sides of it, was made without
anything unusual occurring. While still some miles
north of the island for which they were bound they
could see the smoke of La Soufriere and through
the marine glasses took note of some of the terrible
damage done.</p>

<p>“It is very fortunate that no large city was
located near this volcano,” said Professor Strong.
“No living thing could have escaped such an outburst
as has taken place here.”</p>

<p>When the vessel reached Kingstown harbor the
boys could scarcely wait to get ashore. They
learned that the Windsor Hotel was in a suburb,
and hired a carriage to take them to the hostelry.</p>

<p>“There is father now!” cried Frank, as they
entered the beautiful grounds, and he pointed to a
figure reclining in an invalid chair on the veranda.</p>

<p>“And my father is there, too!” exclaimed Mark.</p>

<p>In another moment they were out of the carriage
and rushing up the veranda steps. As they came<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">[329]</span>
closer both Mr. Newton and Mr. Robertson sat up
to greet them.</p>

<p>“My boy!” cried Mr. Newton, and flung his
arms around Frank. “My own boy!”</p>

<p>“Mark!” came from Mr. Robertson, and his face
broke out into a warm smile of welcome. “We were
just talking about you and wondering if we would
get a letter.”</p>

<p>“You don’t know how glad I am to see you, even
like this, father,” answered Mark. “We were
afraid you had been burnt up.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and we went on a regular search for both
of you,” broke in Frank.</p>

<p>“And they came pretty close to losing their own
lives in that search,” came from the professor, as he
shook hands.</p>

<p>“Then you went ashore—” began Mr. Newton,
in wonder.</p>

<p>“Yes, we went volcano exploring,” said Darry.</p>

<p>“And we climbed Mont Pelee,” finished Sam.
“I don’t believe we’ll ever want to do it again.”</p>

<p>“No,” finished Mark. “Once was enough.
Now we are all safe away from it, I never want to
see the island of Martinique again.”</p>

<p>And the others agreed with him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">[330]</span>Let me add a few words more, and then we will
bring to a close this tale of sight-seeing and adventures
in the West Indies.</p>

<p>What Mr. Newton and Mr. Robertson had written
in their letters concerning their injuries was true.
Although painful, none of the burns were serious,
and they were both doing as well as could be expected.
In a few days each was able to walk a
little, and inside of a month both were practically as
well as ever.</p>

<p>For the time being all business in Martinique,
and a good part of that in St. Vincent, came to a
standstill, and this being so nothing could be done
regarding the dyewood scheme the two gentlemen
had had in mind. Consequently the pair returned
to the United States at the first available opportunity.</p>

<p>“Take good care of yourselves in the future,
boys,” said Mr. Robertson, on leaving.</p>

<p>“And let the active volcanoes alone,” added Mr.
Newton.</p>

<p>And all of the party agreed to heed the advice.</p>

<p>During the time spent in St. Vincent the boys
made one trip northward toward La Soufriere. But
though they inspected the great volcano from a distance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">[331]</span>
they took good care to keep out of the zone of
fire.</p>

<p>“It’s a fearful spot,” said Mark. “Worse even
than around Mont Pelee. It’s a regular Inferno on
earth,” and the others said the same.</p>

<p>At last came the day for the young explorers to
leave St. Vincent. Anxious to learn what had become
of Hockley, who had not answered a letter
sent to Trinidad by him, Professor Strong engaged
passage on a vessel bound for Port-of-Spain.</p>

<p>“Hurrah, we are off at last!” cried Darry, as they
set sail. “Good-bye to the West Indies.”</p>

<p>“After all, the trip through the islands wasn’t so
bad,” said Sam. “We saw lots of interesting
things.”</p>

<p>“I guess we shall see even more interesting things
in the future,” came from Mark.</p>

<p>“Of course, our sight-seeing isn’t half over yet,”
added Frank. He was right, and what the immediate
future held in store for our young friends
will be told in the next volume of this “Pan-American
Series.” In that book we shall meet all
our boys and the professor once more, and learn
of many things as interesting, curious, or exciting as
those related in these pages.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">[332]</span>But for the present we will leave them, and also
these ill-fated islands of the Lesser Antilles, the fate
of which even to-day seems uncertain. Our friends
made a happy group as they steamed rapidly southward,
and here let us say good-bye.</p>
